## Hacking on Content

Create a branch from the `develop` branch.  
To test that branch out you can push to cloud.gov.au before commiting to git.  
Remember to delete unused apps.

`cf push branchname` # assumes you are logged into the staging platform.

Submit a PR to the `develop` branch.  
The develop branch is continuously deployed to https://dta.apps.staging.digital.gov.au/
The master branch is continuously deployed to https://www.digital.gov.au/

When ready for a production deploy:

* `git checkout master`
* `‚Å†git pull`
* `git merge --no-ff develop`
* `git push origin master`
