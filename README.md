www.dta.gov.au is a [Jekyll website](http://jekyllrb.com/).


## Installation

**Ensure you have the pre-requisites installed:**

- [Ruby 2.3.1](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)

Run each of the following commands to get the site running locally:

1. `git clone git@github.com:AusDTO/dta-website.git`
2. `cd dta-website`
3. `bundle install`
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve`

You should be able to see the site at: http://127.0.0.1:4000

To increase the speed of jekyll builds, you can replace the last step with `bin/serve`. This will disable the search plugin and only render the latest post.

## Development Process

The `develop` branch is continuously deployed by circleCI to https://dta.apps.staging.digital.gov.au/

The `master` branch is continuously deployed by circleCI to https://www.dta.gov.au/

When starting a new change, create a branch from the `develop` branch.

To test that branch out you can push to cloud.gov.au before commiting to git. Refer to the [cloud.gov.au documentation](http://docs.cloud.gov.au/) to setup `cf` if needed.

Run each of the following commands to deploy your local site to cloud.gov.au:

1. `bundle exec jekyll build`
2. `cf push branchname` # assumes you are logged into the staging platform.

Remember to delete unused apps when you are done:

`cf delete branchname`

When your change is ready, submit a PR to the `develop` branch.

When ready for a production deploy, merge the `develop` branch to `master`. You can do this through Github [with a PR](https://github.com/AusDTO/dta-website/compare/master...develop) or from the command line:

* `git checkout master`
* `‚Å†git pull`
* `git merge --no-ff develop`
* `git push origin master`
