## Development

### Setup

DTA.GOV.AU is a [Jekyll website](http://jekyllrb.com/). You will need to have [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) installed to manage Ruby and RubyGems.

Setup dta.gov.au locally

```
git clone git@github.com:AusDTO/dta-website.git
cd dta-website
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Launch dta.gov.au locally

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

You should be able to see the site at: http://127.0.0.1:4000

## Hacking on Content

Create a branch from the `develop` branch.  

To test that branch out you can push to cloud.gov.au before commiting to git.

`cf push branchname` # assumes you are logged into the staging platform.

Remember to delete unused apps:

`cf delete branchname`

When your change is ready, submit a PR to the `develop` branch.
The develop branch is continuously deployed to https://dta.apps.staging.digital.gov.au/
The master branch is continuously deployed to https://www.dta.gov.au/

When ready for a production deploy, merge the `develop` branch to `master`. You can do this through Github [with a PR](https://github.com/AusDTO/dta-website/compare/master...develop) or from the command line:

* `git checkout master`
* `‚Å†git pull`
* `git merge --no-ff develop`
* `git push origin master`
