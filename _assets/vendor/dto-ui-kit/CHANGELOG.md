# UI Kit Changelog

## UI Kit "Kraken"

### 1.10.3 - 2016-11-10

- Switches from flexbox to floats for the site navigation feature.
- Undoes link-button mixin application to the `header[role='banner']` from 1.10.0.

### 1.10.2 - 2016-11-9

- Fixed `ui-kit.js` Gulp task so that minified version is created

### 1.10.1 - 2016-11-8

- Update version number in package.json so that it's SemVer valid (X.Y.Z)

### 1.10.0 - 2016-11-8

#### UI-Kit changes

#### Larger changes

- New: site navigation and page header features — see *§ Navigation: Site navigation* and *§ Page header* in the Design Guide.
- The same link styles (via the `link-colours` mixin) for `article` are now applied to `header[role='banner']`.
- Removes the min-width from the `$mobile-only` breakpoint.

#### Smaller changes

- Footer improvements:
  - adds `ie-clearfix` mixin
  - improves margins when footer link `ul`s collapse in mobile–tablet views and footer crest margins
  - centers image and copyright footer content in mobile view.
- `.lede` has been added, synonymous with `.abstract`, accessible on block elements (not `p` tags).
- Link styles are now applied to the `<main>` element instead of `<article>`

### 1.9 - 2016-11-07

#### Large changes

- Moved font sizing declarations to `body`, rather than applying them to `ul`, `ol`, `p`, `dt`, `dd`, etc. directly. This should avoid the need to apply `font-size: 1em` resets for nested content, eg a `p` or `ul` > `li` inside a `table` > `td`.
Adds a new gulp task (`styleguide.data`) which outputs a JSON file of all the SASS comment sections (and their children, nested). This is being used by the new `dto-design-guide` Jekyll repository.

#### Bugfixes

- `main` now receives the same `padding-top` at mobile sizes that it received at tablet+ sizes (fix for content hugging the top of `main`/the page `header`).
- Changes `.inline-nav` to `.inline-tab-nav` as actually documented.
- Fixed Vertical lists not displaying correctly in IE7-8.
- Fixes global menu not opening completely on iOS 9 [#365](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/issues/365).
- Fixes to button styles [#328](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/issues/328).
- Fix for missing feedback button on mobile [#348](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/issues/348). Header feedback button continues to be hidden on mobile but support is now provided for a feedback button to be used in the footer which is visible at mobile sizes.

#### Styleguide

- Renamed the design guide website to *DTO Design Guide & UI-Kit*.
- Renamed complete example page to 'all' (`/examples/all.html`).
- Reformatted component example `.hbs` files to a max line character length of 80.
- Update name of Slack channel from `#govau-uikit`/`#govau-guides` to `#guides-uikit`

#### UI-Kit changes

- Changes current uppercase site title topbar to be set-case and removes `letter-spacing`.

### 1.8.0 - 2016-09-09

#### UI-Kit changes

- Added styles for accordions used in the primary content area `details`, and when used in widgets or filters:  `details.accordion--controls`.
- Added `accordion-styles` mixin for creating alternative accordion styles if required. See `_accordions.scss`.
- Changed visual design throughout (minor).
- Changed local navigation font size to be smaller than body copy for better visual hierarchy.
- Added `mixins` for IE-conditional styles and stylesheets for old IE versions
- Changed structure of `assets/sass` directory
- Changed animation of collapsible elements from CSS to JS transitions
- Changed undocumented (experimental) header styles to use a background image instead of CSS gradient.

- Added visible focus/hover on Local navigation menu button [#323](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/issues/323).
- Added styles for usage of placeholder links in the Local navigation [#290](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/issues/290).
- Headings 2 to 6 used in `.list-horizontal` or `.list-vertical` list types are now styled to match H4 to address issues with visual hierarchy versus semantic hierarchy [#299](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/issues/299).
- Change git merge strategy for CHANGELOG.md to reduce conflicts

#### Styleguide

- Added guide to [/docs/](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/tree/develop/docs) on installing and using UI-Kit via `npm`.

### 1.7.6 - 2016-09-01

#### UI-Kit changes

- Desktop: Content area is now 12 columns wide to accommodate larger block elements. In response basic text elements `h1-h6, p, li, dl` now have a max-width for readability. See `_grid-layout.scss`
- Desktop: Added `.content-full-width` as a method of making basic text elements fill to 12 columns if required (see above).

#### Styleguide

- Added guidance for font usage and accessibility (documented under *§ Typography - Typeface*).
- IE conditional styling statements added for the gov.au demo: `head` in `examples/` edited so that ≤IE9 receives no styling except a warning message; ≥IE9 gets styling. These IE conditionals are solely for demo purposes and will be removed in the future.
