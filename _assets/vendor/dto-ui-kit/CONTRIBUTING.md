# Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to the Gov AU UI Kit. The UI Kit is an evolving project and relies on help and feedback to improve.

**Found a bug while using the framework or guide?**
Let us know by [raising an issue](#submitting-an-issue).

**Have a suggestion for a new feature?**
If you can reach us on Slack, visit us in #guides-uikit and let us know. If you're not on Slack, that's fine, just [open an issue](#submitting-an-issue)

If your suggestion is not already in our roadmap, we'll probably suggest that you make a fork of our repo and then [open a pull request](submitting-a-pr) so that we can review your changes or additions and hopefully merge them in.

We encourage you to read our [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md). By ensuring that all staff and contributors follow this guide we can maintain an inclusive and friendly environment.

We've also put together some [Coding Convention guidelines](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/blob/master/conventions.md)
which explain our code style and linting.

Finally, if you're unsure about anything, just ask â€” or submit your issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is we'll politely ask you to change something. We appreciate all friendly contributions.

## Guidelines

### Submitting a pull request

Here are a few guidelines to follow when submitting a pull request:

1. Create a GitHub account or sign in to your existing account.

[https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
1. Create a branch that lightly defines what you're working on, prefixed with '/feature' (for example, feature/add-styles).

1. Once you're ready to submit a pull request, fill out the PULL REQUEST template provided.
1. Submit your pull request against the `develop` branch.
