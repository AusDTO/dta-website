The Medicare Newborn Enrolment service began before the Digital Service Standard became live. This means the service was assessed against the [beta version](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/changes-to-standard/) of the Standard. The team is in the process of transitioning to the live Standard. 

## Areas of good performance

The team has worked cohesively through the project, taking an agile and user centred approach to the delivery of the service.

The user research included a diverse range of users, ensuring the team had a good understanding of the different cohorts that will interact with the service.

The team has been responsive to user needs, iterating the design of the process and documentation.

The continued iteration of the high level design documentation gave a clear picture of the management of the data, and how the security, privacy and storage of data was to be transferred from Gold Coast University Hospital (GCUH) to DHS systems.

The measurement of the processing time of enrolments for the DHS staff showed a significant reduction, approximately 50% in many cases.

The service map developed by the team was used to try and ‘break’ the service. It showed that there was clear thinking around processes and potential edge cases and interactions with other touch points, giving insight to where the service could be further iterated to improve the end user experience.

## On the path to public Beta

The team have worked closely with the GCUH and DHS processing staff to implement the service.

The processing time for DHS staff has been significantly reduced and the feedback from parents and staff has been very positive.

The team will need to continue to plan for further research, ensuring they are capturing the user experience of those using and delivering the service, and iterating the service where appropriate.

The team has moved back into the DHS environment. A small core team are taking the service forward and determining the long term outcome for the service.

The team advised that they intend to continue with ceremonies and user led service design and to continue to influence the way the department works, helping it understand the agile, user centred way of delivering services. 

The private beta service was trialled at the GCUH however, further investigation is required to and scale up the service for other hospitals.

The high level technical design will need to expand to meet the challenges that will be presented by a more diverse range of data from different hospitals.

The team used the [HEART framework](http://www.dtelepathy.com/ux-metrics/) to develop baseline metrics for the service. They have been working on metrics for both the HEART framework and the KPIs.

The team has developed a sound process for the extraction and processing of data from GCUH to DHS. They have developed security protocols that underpin the data management between GCUH and DHS. However, scaling this service and extending it to other hospitals will require further technical investigation to ensure the process is repeatable. 

## Keeping up with the Medicare Newborn Enrolment service

This service introduced the use of a simple consent form to improve the process for parents of newborns to receive a Medicare card. It leverages hospital data that is already captured at admission.

There is no URL for the service. 

### Code 

Code repository:  There has been no code developed for this project, therefore no requirement for a code repository. The service has not been assessed against Criterion 8. 

### Metrics
Performance dashboard: [Medicare Newborn Enrolment](https://dashboard.gov.au/dashboards/6-medicare-newborn-enrolment-dashboard)

### Benefits 

Benefits that were identified during inflight check-ins included:

- A significant decrease in processing time for DHS staff per enrolment
- A simple process for parents to enrol their newborn quickly
- The hospital captures the baby’s name  from parents, giving a more complete medical record that commences from birth
