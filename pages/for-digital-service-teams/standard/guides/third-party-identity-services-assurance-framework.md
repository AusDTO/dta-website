The Third Party Identity Services Assurance Framework is an Australian Government approach for accreditation of identity services offered by commercial service providers to government agencies. The Assurance Framework describes 4 levels of assurance (LOA) with performance outcomes and standards for identity service providers working with government.

The Assurance Framework is based on an understanding that users should have choice about which service they use to access digital government services. It also states users should not be forced to hold multiple credentials to access the range of government services they need.

> **Policy requirement**: agencies that use the following identity services should use providers accredited under the Third Party Identity Services Assurance Framework at the appropriate level of assurance.

Identity services covered by the Assurance Framework:

- verification services, which enable people to have claims regarding their identity or other attributes verified online
- authentication services, which provide people with credentials (for example, a username and password) to enable access to a variety of digital services
- digital mailboxes, which enable people to receive correspondence from participating agencies in a single digital inbox
- personal data vaults, which enable people to store and retrieve their personal data electronically, including the storage of electronic copies of personal records such as birth certificates.
