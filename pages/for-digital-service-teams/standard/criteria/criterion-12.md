## Why it’s in the Standard

People often start using a service and have to come back to it later, or switch to a non-digital channel to complete the transaction. We need to make sure users’ transitions between non-digital and digital channels, when they need to happen, are as smooth as possible.

## How you'll be assessed

During [Discovery](/for-digital-service-teams/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/discovery/) and Alpha you should have developed a good understanding of where users will go for the service you are building. You should understand what proportion of users rely on non-digital channels, wholly or in part, and have a plan for how you will address this in your build. 

During Alpha you should show you understand:

- all the touchpoints in users’ journeys, their contexts of use, and the digital limitations affecting different groups of users 
- existing channels and how they interact with the service and with each other
- the channels required to support all groups of users of the service, and where a user may need to change channels 
- if there are any repeat transactions by users over different channels
- the interactions occurring between the channels that deliver and capture user transactions.

During the Beta stage you will apply the knowledge gained in Alpha to design a service that works with the other channels, as appropriate. 

By the end of Beta and going live, you should:

- detail the channels required to support all groups of users of the service  
- understand the non-digital service channels and have a [plan to move users to the digital channel](/for-digital-service-teams/standard/13-encourage-use-of-the-digital-service/) where appropriate
- have developed and tested the service so that a user can change channels without repeating themselves.
