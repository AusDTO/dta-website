## How we engage

We work with people from across sectors and industries to deliver digital transformation. 

Together we collaborate, showcase work, solve problems and explore best practice. We do this through a range of forums, roundtables and communities of practice. 

We also provide advice on digital transformation and participate in a number of working groups and governance committees within the Australian Government.  

### Australian Government

We regularly engage with agencies across the Australian Government in both formal and informal ways. 

#### Digital 10 

Meeting monthly the Digital 10 Working Group brings together Chief Information Officers and Deputy Secretaries from the major portfolios driving digital transformation including the Departments of:

- Prime Minister and Cabinet 
- Health
- Defence
- Border Protection and Immigration 
- Industry, Innovation and Science
- Human Services
- Finance
- Attorney General
- Australian Taxation Office
- Australian Digital Health Agency

#### CIO forum 

Every six weeks we host a forum just for Chief Information Officers (CIOs) within the Australian Government. In this forum, CIOs are encouraged to share experiences from the private sector, showcase transformation work and collaborate on challenges. 

#### PMO roundtable 

Every six weeks we chair leaders in the Program Management Offices of major portfolios driving digital transformation.  

#### Private Sector 

We are exploring a formal partnership with the Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA) for greater private and public sector collaboration on digital transformation. 

We also work closely with private sector organisations on various digital transformation projects. 

#### Non-Government Sector 

We are establishing formal engagements with the not-for-profit and non-government sector to work through challenges arising from digital transformation work. Organisations include:

- advocacy groups
- privacy groups 
- consumer organisations

#### International engagement

It’s important for us to stay connected with the international community. This allows us to learn from their experiences, share our own, and include international ideas in our digital transformation work. 

#### OECD digital economy  

We represent Australia internationally on the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for the digital economy. We join with 35 nations to explore ideas for an open and interconnected digital world including: 

- developing better policies 
- ensuring security and privacy 
- fostering economic and social prosperity

#### Open Government Partnership 

We are supporting the delivery of four commitments as part of Australia’s first [Open Government National Action Plan](https://ogpau.pmc.gov.au/commitment/51-open-government-forum) delivered by the Department Prime Minister and Cabinet to strengthen governance: 

- promote transparency
- empower citizens
- fight corruption
- harness new technologies
