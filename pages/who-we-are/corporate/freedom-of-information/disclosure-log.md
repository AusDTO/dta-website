We publish a disclosure log on our website to meet the requirements of the *Freedom of Information Act 1982*. Our disclosure log lists information that we have given out in response to an FOI request.

The disclosure log does not apply to:

* personal information about any person if publication of that information would be ‘unreasonable’
* information about the business, commercial, financial or professional affairs of any person if publication of that information would be ‘unreasonable’
* other information covered by a determination made by the Australian Information Commissioner if publication of that information would be ‘unreasonable’
* any information if it is not reasonably practicable to publish the information because of the extent of modifications that would need to be made to delete the information listed in the above dot points.

The information described in this register is available for public access. You can find the register at the bottom of this page.

If a document named in the disclosure log is not available for download you can request a copy by writing to: [foi@digital.gov.au](mailto:foi@digital.gov.au)

You can also send requests to:

The FOI Coordinator<br/>
Digital Transformation Agency<br/>
PO Box 457<br/>
Canberra, ACT 2601<br/>

We may charge you a fee to cover the cost incurred in copying or reproducing the information or sending it to you. We will try to meet all requests for an alternative format of the document in a timely manner and at the lowest reasonable cost to you.

We will remove documents from the disclosure log after 12 months, unless they have enduring public value.

We may have deleted some parts of the documents, under the exemptions in the FOI Act.
