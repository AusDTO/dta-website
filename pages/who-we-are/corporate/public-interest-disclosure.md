lede: We’ve all heard the term ‘whistleblowing’ - The Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 (PID Act), replaced the whistleblowing provisions in January 2014. But it’s not just about a name change.

<h2>About the Commonwealth Public Interest Disclosure (PID) scheme</h2>
<p>The purpose of the <a href="http://www.ombudsman.gov.au/about/making-a-disclosure">PID scheme</a> is to:</p>
<ul><li>encourage the report of suspected wrongdoing</li>
<li>make agencies responsible for managing disclosures</li>
<li>ensure disclosures are properly investigated and dealt with</li>
<li>protect and support disclosers who make reports of wrongdoing</li>
</ul><p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2013A00133">The Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013</a> applies to this scheme and protects people making disclosures in most cases. The Act applies across the Australian Government public sector.</p>
<h2>What information&nbsp;can I report?</h2>
<p>You can report / disclose information that you believe on reasonable grounds tends to show, wrongdoing within an Australian Government agency, or by a public official, or a Commonwealth contracted service provider.</p>
<p>You may disclose the following types of suspected wrongdoing:</p>
<ul><li>Contravention of a law</li>
<li>Corruption</li>
<li>Conduct that perverts the course of justice</li>
<li>Wastage of public funds</li>
<li>Conduct that is an abuse of public trust</li>
<li>Conduct that unreasonably endangers health and safety or endangers the environment</li>
<li>Misconduct relating to scientific research, analysis or advice</li>
<li>Maladministration, including conduct that is unjust, oppressive or negligent</li>
<li>Conduct that is an abuse of a public official’s position</li>
<li>Conduct that, if proved, would result in disciplinary action against a public official</li>
</ul><p>You cannot disclose:</p>
<ul><li>the proper activities of intelligence agencies</li>
<li>disagreements that relate only to government policy (and related expenditure)</li>
<li>the actions of parliamentarians.</li>
</ul><p>Not all matters will fall under the PID Act. It may be more appropriate for your disclosure to be dealt with <a href="http://www.ombudsman.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0029/84818/Finding-the-right-outcome.pdf">under another process.</a></p>
<p>Also, matters that have already been subject to a previous investigation process may not be further investigated under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013.</p>

</ul><p>You can also report anonymously, however:</p>
<ul><li>we cannot ensure you are protected from all reprisal action</li>

<h2>Protections offered under the PID Act</h2>
<p>If you make a public interest disclosure under the Act (even if an investigation subsequently determines that there was no wrongdoing), you are protected in two ways.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Liability:</h3>
<p>You cannot be subject to any civil, criminal or administrative liability, including disciplinary action, for making a disclosure in accordance with the PID Act, and no contractual or other remedy can be enforced against you on the basis of your disclosure.</p>
<p>This protection does not apply if you knowingly make a statement that is false or misleading. It also does not apply if you knowingly contravene, without a reasonable excuse, certain publication restrictions listed in the PID Act.</p>
<h3>Reprisal:</h3>
<p>You are also protected against reprisal. It is an offence for any person to cause you any detriment because they suspect or believe that you made or will make a public interest disclosure.</p>
<h2>Information you will need to provide</h2>
<p>The Commonwealth Ombudsman’s Guide to making a Disclosure includes helpful information on what to include in your report of suspected wrongdoing</p>
<ul><li>your name and contact details unless you wish to remain anonymous</li>
<li>the nature of the wrongdoing</li>
<li>who committed the wrongdoing</li>
<li>when and where the wrongdoing occurred</li>
<li>relevant background information and events</li>
<li>if anything has been done in response to the wrongdoing</li>
<li>contact details for anyone else who is aware of the wrongdoing and has allowed it to continue</li>
<li>whether you believe the information is a public interest disclosure under the PID Act. However, it does not need to be described this way for it to be treated as a public interest disclosure</li>
<li>if you are concerned about possible reprisal as a result of making a disclosure</li>
</ul><h2>More information</h2>
