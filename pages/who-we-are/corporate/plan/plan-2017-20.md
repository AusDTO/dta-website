As the accountable authority of the Digital Transformation Agency, I am pleased to present our 2017–18 corporate plan, which covers the periods of 2017–18 to 2020–21, as required under paragraph 35 (1)(b) of the *Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.*

This plan includes our purposes, activities and what we want to achieve for the next four years.

I am committed to ensuring that the DTA is fully effective and trusted in carrying out our role. This plan will help equip us in strengthening our remit to successfully lead transformation across government and have central oversight of the government’s ICT agenda.

Nerida O’Loughlin\\
Interim Chief Executive

{% include hx.html lvl=2 text="DTA's purpose and role" insert-hr=1 %}

We constantly refresh and build upon our knowledge so we can lead and guide.

Over the next four years we will work *with* departments and agencies, not independently of them, to develop solutions together, which can then be shared across the rest of government.

This collaborative approach also helps us transfer skills and expertise, ideas and experience, and connects government to government, building greater capability across the Australian Public Service.

We bring to our role a unique set of capabilities. We are focused on user-centred design, use agile methodologies, have strong technology skills as well as assurance capabilities.

We are not responsible for every ICT and digital project underway in government. But we can help departments and agencies who are accountable to create and deliver their products effectively.

{% include hx.html lvl=3 text="Our purpose statement" hide-back-to-top=1 %}

> Over the next four years our clear mandate is to drive user-centered service delivery and improve transparency of the benefits, costs and risks
of ICT and digital investments made across the Australian Government

{% include hx.html lvl=2 text="Capability" insert-hr=1 %}

A skilled, motivated and flexible workforce is required to achieve our purpose. Over the period of the plan, our people strategy will identify and address future gaps in capability through workforce planning, leadership development and capability development.

In addition to our own capability development,the Australian Public Service will need to build new ICT and digital capabilities to transform government services.

New skills need to be future-proof and cater to users accessing government information and services through different channels.

A contemporary skills set is user-centred and follows an agile approach teamed with fit-for-purpose technology capabilities.

These will need to be embedded across government, at all levels.

{% include hx.html lvl=3 text="Our culture and values" insert-hr=1 %}

We support staff to build their capabilities. We encourage staff to work towards their career goals while ensuring we continue to support the government now and into the future.

{% include hx.html lvl=4 text="As Australian public servants" hide-back-to-top=1 %}

We follow the Australian Public Service's ICARE values.

{% include hx.html lvl=5 text="Impartial" hide-back-to-top=1 %}

We are apolitical and provide the government with advice that is frank, honest, timely and based on the best available
evidence.

{% include hx.html lvl=5 text="Committed to service" hide-back-to-top=1 %}

We are professional, objective, innovative and efficient, and work collaboratively to achieve the best results for the
Australian community and the government.

{% include hx.html lvl=5 text="Accountable" hide-back-to-top=1 %}

We are open and accountable to the Australian community under the law and within the framework of ministerial responsibility.

{% include hx.html lvl=5 text="Respectful" hide-back-to-top=1 %}

We respect all people, including their rights and their heritage.

{% include hx.html lvl=5 text="Ethical" hide-back-to-top=1 %}

We demonstrate leadership, are trustworthy, and act with integrity, in all that we do.

{% include hx.html lvl=3 text="Our people" hide-back-to-top=1 %}

- We are collaborative, consultative and committed to common success
- We provide expert advice and work in partnership to deliver strategic, creative and future-focused products,  policy and services
- We are optimistic, pro-active and resilient in finding ways to innovate
- We seek to understand our users and our partners, their ambitions, constraints and capabilities

{% include hx.html lvl=2 text="Operating environment" insert-hr=1 %}

The DTA's strategic priorities will be driven by three trends in our operating environment over the next four years.

{% include hx.html lvl=3 text="User expectations" hide-back-to-top=1 %}

People need government services to be as easy to access, simple to use and available as services provided by the private sector.

They want the flexibility to access services through their choice of channels and not be told that they can't.

These expectations are increasing as the quality gap between government and non-government services widens. This needs to be met.

{% include hx.html lvl=3 text="Efficient government investment" hide-back-to-top=1 %}

In 2015–16, non-corporate government agencies invested more than $6 billion in ICT. There are potential efficiencies from a more coordinated and collaborative approach to investment.

There is also potential to build platforms that can be reused by others providing greater leverage of government funding.

More coordinated and strategic oversight will improve risk identification and mitigation and ensure products deliver real benefits.

{% include hx.html lvl=3 text="Service and technology innovation" hide-back-to-top=1 %}

The current complexity of policy and regulation directly impacts on service delivery and innovation.

Designing services that reflect user needs, and apply smart, efficient technologies, should be as much of a focus for government as it is for the non-government sector.

By applying new ways of design thinking with technological innovation, previously unsolvable problems can be addressed.

Building services that reflect real life events, not government structures will require strong collaboration but will better meet user needs.

Better data collection and analytics will also help design and create better services.

{% include hx.html lvl=3 text="The digital transformation agenda" hide-back-to-top=1 %}

The government’s vision for digital transformation starts with user needs — that it will be simple and fast to get things done with government, through any channel. The government has developed a [digital transformation agenda](/what-we-do/transformation-agenda/) that consists of the following:

- Owned by all government agencies
- Coordinated and assisted by the DTA
- Focused on changing the way government interacts with, and provides services to, users
- Aimed at driving reform of policies and processes that stand in the way of transformation
- Aligned with other whole-of-government reform agendas

The digital transformation agenda will evolve over time as impediments are removed, strategies are delivered and benefits realised. Key performance indicators will be developed and made available publicly for initiatives that will deliver on the digital transformation agenda. Whole-of-government indicators will also be developed.

{% include hx.html lvl=4 text="The digital transformation roadmap" hide-back-to-top=1 %}

A digital transformation roadmap has been developed to recognise and track significant transformation projects across government over the next four years.

{% include hx.html lvl=3 text="Strategic priorities" insert-hr=1 %}

The government has set a single outcome for the DTA in its [Portfolio Budget Statement](https://www.dpmc.gov.au/resource-centre/pmc/portfolio-budget-statements-2016-2017):

> To improve the user experience for all Australians accessing government information and services by leading the
design, development and continual enhancement of whole-of-government service delivery policies and standards, platforms
and joined-up services.

Over the next four years, we have identified five strategic priorities that will drive digital transformation and guide our work over the life of this corporate plan.

- The actions outlined below will support the delivery of these priorities
- Performance criteria will be used to measure our success
- Progress will be reported through our Annual Report
