<p>Gavin Slater<br />Chief Executive Officer</p>
<h3>2017–2020 Corporate Plan purpose</h3>
<p>We constantly refresh and build upon our knowledge so we can lead and guide.</p>
<p>Over the next four years we will work with departments and agencies, not independently of them, to develop solutions together, which can then be shared across the rest of government.</p>
<p>This collaborative approach also helps us transfer skills and expertise, ideas and experience, and connects government to government, building greater capability across the Australian Public Service.</p>
<p>We bring to our role a unique set of capabilities. We are focused on user-centred design, use agile methodologies, have strong technology skills as well as assurance capabilities.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for every ICT and digital project underway in government, but we can help departments and agencies who are accountable to create and deliver their products effectively.</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>The relevant outcome is included in the Portfolio Budget Statements 2016–17 Budget Related Paper No. 1.14. The Portfolio Additional Estimate Statements 2016–17 acknowledges the Order to Rename the Digital Transformation Office to the Digital Transformation Agency on 27 October 2016.</p>
<p>Outcome 1: To improve the user experience for all Australians accessing government information and services by leading the design, development and continual enhancement of whole-of-government service delivery policies and standards, platforms and joined- up services.</p>
<h3>Performance results – Digital Transformation Agency</h3>
<p>The Digital Transformation Agency performance statement is prepared according to the single outcome in the Portfolio Budget Statements 2016–17 and the Portfolio Additional Estimate Statements 2016–17. </p>
<p>The DTA’s Corporate Plan was released in March 2017 and the measurement of the strategies outlined in that plan are currently being implemented. The agency identified five key priorities in the Corporate Plan and progress against each is as follows. </p>

          <p>In 2016–17, the DTA established the Digital Investment Management Office, to improve how agencies initiate, plan and deliver digital and ICT investments across government, including two key functions, the Portfolio Management Office and the Digital Investment Office. </p>
          <p>The Portfolio Management Office identifies risks, clarifies benefits, monitors initiatives and provides oversight to increase the probability that the government’s digital and ICT investments are successful.</p>
          <p>The Digital Investment Office provides advice to government on future ICT investments. The office engages early with agencies that are bringing forward new proposals to be considered by the government, to ensure they align with the government’s agenda and priorities. </p>
          <p>The Digital Investment Management Office’s advice and actions help the government modernise and maintain critical infrastructure, make the right investments in the right way, to produce the right benefits.</p>
          <p>As at 30 June 2017, the Digital Investment Management Office had prepared <br />11 Gold Briefs for government at a value of over $1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>As at 30 June 2017, the Digital Investment Management Office data collection <br />had identified 55 projects with a value of over $10 million. </p>

The DTA contributed a specialist cross-disciplinary team of user researchers, content designers, interaction designers and agile development skills to the project, while the DHS contributed programmers, testers and other technical resources. </p>
          <p>The DTA coordinates three whole of government communities of practice in content design, service design and portfolio, program and project management. These communities collaborate to solve problems and explore best practice. They are open to anyone in local, state/territory and commonwealth government.</p>
