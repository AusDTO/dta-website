<p>I am pleased to present the 2016–17 annual report for the Digital Transformation Agency, which outlines the progress we have made to move more government services to digital channels, improve the user experience and achieve better returns on the government’s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) spend.</p>

<p>I was delighted to be appointed as Chief Executive Officer on 1 May 2017 and thank my predecessor Nerida O’Loughlin for her leadership while she was interim CEO.</p>

<p>Over the past year, the agency has delivered and progressed important programs of work and has taken on new ICT and digital functions as a result of a new and strengthened remit.</p>

<p>This included taking responsibility for ICT procurement, a new oversight and advisory role of the government’s major ICT projects and managing the government’s ICT entry-level programs.</p>

<p>Among our achievements, we set up a Digital Investment Management Office to provide oversight and advice to government on its whole ICT and digital project portfolio.</p>

<p>We developed and delivered a performance dashboard for agencies to publicly report on how their services are performing and we expanded our Digital Marketplace platform to deliver better opportunities for government and the private sector to do business.</p>

<p>We have progressed a whole-of-government content strategy to improve the content government websites deliver to users, and a strategy to move more government agencies onto secure cloud.</p>

<p>Our partnerships work with agencies to develop, deliver and improve their service delivery has helped to build digital skills capability in public service teams.</p>

<p>By adopting agile project methodologies, applying the Digital Service Standard and drawing on our stock of tools and guides, skills are transferred to public service staff working in joint project teams. Our work with the Department of Human Services to deliver important improvements to the myGov portal is a good example of this.</p>

<p>With the ICT entry-level programs moving within our remit, we have also supported the recruitment of exciting new talent joining the public service as ICT apprentices, cadets and graduates. The new recruits are part of our digital future and will play an instrumental role in helping to uplift digital capability across government.</p>

<p>I believe the DTA is well positioned to support the government’s key objectives, which are to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>move more services to digital channels</li>
  <li>improve the user experience for individuals and businesses</li>
  <li>improve the return on ICT and digital investment.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the coming year, we will focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>developing a digital transformation roadmap</li>
  <li>delivering and improving shared digital platforms</li>
  <li>overseeing and advising on ICT and digital investment</li>
  <li>transforming ICT procurement</li>
  <li>building Australian Public Service ICT and digital capability.</li>
</ul>

<p>I look forward to working with our colleagues across the public service and the private sector to deliver on these priorities.</p>

<p>I am excited about the opportunities ahead and thank the DTA for its commitment to leading the transformation work.</p>

{% include hx.html lvl=2 text="Evolution of the DTA" %}

<p>Demand for digital government services has been rapidly growing for many years. People are more reliant on digital channels than ever before, and expect a quick and simple engagement with government, just as they have with business.</p>

<p>The DTA was established in response to this user need. It was also important to break down government siloes that limited innovation and instead benefit from shared experiences, insights and platforms. By building digital capability within government we can ensure that our people and infrastructure are prepared for the digital innovations of the future.</p>
