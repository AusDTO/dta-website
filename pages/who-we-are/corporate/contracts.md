## Why we publish this information

On 20 June 2001, the Senate agreed to an Order requiring each Minister to table a letter advising that a list of contracts in respect of each entity administered by that Minister has been placed on the Internet, with access to the list through the entity home page.

The letter must be tabled no later than two calendar months after the end of the calendar and financial years.

An amendment to the Order of 14 May 2015 requires all procurement contracts be listed in a report on the AusTender website, with non-procurement contracts to be listed on entity websites.
