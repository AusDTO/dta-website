## Annual performance statements

### Statement of compliance by the accountable authority

I, as the accountable authority of the Digital Transformation Office (DTO), present the 2015–16 annual performance statements of the DTO, as required under paragraph 39(1)(a) of the *Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013* (PGPA Act). In my opinion, these annual performance statements are based on properly maintained records, accurately reflect the performance of the entity, and comply with subsection 39(2) of the PGPA Act.

Chief Executive Officer**

{% include hx.html lvl=3 text="Purpose" %}

The DTO’s purpose is to facilitate the digital transformation of Australian Government services through innovative and collaborative development of service delivery policies and standards, platforms and joined-up services. 

As the DTO did not have a corporate plan in 2015–16, the DTO’s purpose for the reporting period has been aligned with its portfolio outcome: 

<div class="indented" markdown ="1">
Outcome 1: To improve the user experience for all Australians accessing government information and services by leading the design, development and continual enhancement of whole-of-government service delivery policies and standards, platforms and joined-up services.
</div>
### Performance

In its inaugural year, the DTO set an ambitious agenda to implement a new approach to service delivery and product development in the Australian Public Service (APS). To achieve its purpose, the DTO established deliverables that required key service delivery agencies to embrace the unknown and believe in the vision and capability of the DTO. The DTO found great allies across the APS who embraced the opportunity to transform government services through an agile approach that focused on user needs.

#### Digital Service Standard

Through consultation with consumers and stakeholders across government, the DTO published the Digital Service Standard on 6 May 2016. The standard ensures that all digital teams across the APS build government services that are simple, clear and fast for all users.

The standard is being applied to all public-facing Australian Government services and information sites administered by non-corporate Commonwealth entities. The standard applies to:

  - new and redesigned government services, informational and transactional
  - all high-volume transactional services (over 50,000 transactions a year), existing or being designed/redesigned.

The publishing of the standard created a need for expert advice and facilitation to enable agencies to transition services to the new standard. The DTO established two digital transformation hubs, one in Canberra and one in Sydney, which provide dedicated workspaces for redesigning key government services.

In addition, many agencies undertook the development and redesign of services in house. The DTO’s assessments of such services against the standard can be found at www.dto.gov.au/standard/assessments/.

{% include hx.html lvl=4 text="Easier ways to access government services" %}

In conjunction with releasing the Digital Service Standard, the DTO began developing five platforms to provide individuals and businesses with easier ways to access government services.

##### *GOV.AU*

In March 2016, the DTO publicly released the alpha version of GOV.AU (www.gov.au/alpha/), a program of work with the vision of creating a place where users can find anything to do with the Australian Government without having to visit multiple websites to access key services. This was a major step in providing customers with a simplified and navigable mechanism for accessing the enormous volume of information and services that the government and APS provide in digital form.
In conjunction with the development and release of GOV.AU, the DTO worked with entities across the APS to develop a content style guide to assist government as a whole to shape its voice, project consistency, convey trust and communicate clearly.

##### *Digital Marketplace*

As part of the National Innovation and Science Agenda, the DTO has started development of the Digital Marketplace.

The aim of the Digital Marketplace is to transform the way government buyers procure digital and technology services and to make it easier for businesses—especially small and medium enterprises and start-ups—to deliver digital services to government.

The DTO took the first step towards establishing the Digital Marketplace in March 2016, by publishing a request for tender for digital specialists interested in providing services to government in an agile way.

This process established a panel that will be accessible through future iterations of the Digital Marketplace. This will connect federal, state and territory government buyers with a range of digital sellers pre-approved to bid for government work.

The discovery phase commenced in April 2016, and involved six weeks of user research with government buyers and ICT professionals. The team then entered the alpha phase and tested the prototype with users.

##### *cloud.gov.au*

In 2015–16, the DTO developed the first version of cloud.gov.au to make delivering and operating digital services easier. The platform makes it easier for teams to release, monitor and grow user-facing digital services, by:
  - providing the infrastructure, monitoring and delivery tools required to release and operate user-facing web applications that meet user needs
  - making it simpler for teams to adopt best practices in releasing software
  - simplifying the security accreditation process for new services.

The platform has been tested with teams in the DTO delivery hubs. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection is also using the platform.

##### *Performance Dashboard*

The DTO has created the Performance Dashboard, a platform to assist government entities to publicly measure the performance of services against the metrics defined by criterion 11 of the Digital Service Standard. The platform will increase the visibility of how well government services are performing and drive the continued improvement of services for users.
In May 2016, a working alpha version was released with performance data for myGov, at [dashboard.gov.au](http://www.dashboard.gov.au/).

##### *Digital authentication and verification*

The DTO commenced the discovery phase of the digital authentication and verification program in January 2016. The program aims to provide a platform that will allow users to establish their identity once only when using different government services online.

In 2015–16, the DTO began building an alpha version of a service to verify the identity of individuals to a level that means they can access government services. To make it easier for government agencies to work together, the DTO also began development of the Trusted Digital Verification and Authentication Framework.

{% include hx.html lvl=4 text="Exemplars and partnerships" %}

In 2015–16, the DTO partnered with other agencies to deliver exemplar projects in its delivery hubs. The DTO has worked with:

  - the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to deliver a new online appointment booking service for citizenship applicants, and a digital permits service to simplify the import of goods requiring a permit.
  - the Department of Human Services to deliver a simpler Medicare enrolment process for newborn children (currently under trial), and improvements to the myGov user experience
  - the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science to deliver a service to help users understand if their hobby is classified as a business
  - the ACT Government to deliver an appointment booking service for new parents with ACT Health
  - the Queensland Government on a pilot program of improvements to the senior citizens’ entitlements service.

Table 1 outlines the DTO’s performance against portfolio budget statements performance criteria.

The key performance indicators (KPIs) for 2015–16 were defined when the DTO commenced in the Communications portfolio, and retained when the DTO was transferred to the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio. The targets for 2015–16 were defined in the Prime Minister and Cabinet Portfolio Budget Statements 2016–17.

{% include hx.html lvl=3 text="Analysis" %}

The DTO was established as an executive agency in the Communications portfolio in July 2015 and transferred to the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio in September 2015.

The DTO had a rapid start-up in its first 12 months. This involved recruiting a workforce, including a large number of contractors; establishing bases in Canberra and Sydney; developing organisational capacity and enabling services; and delivering whole-of-government priorities.

It is rare for a Commonwealth entity to be built from scratch rather than shaped from an amalgam of parts of other entities. As a brand-new organisation, the DTO did not have its own corporate memory and culture and did not inherit all the necessary corporate support systems and administrative processes.

The result was a split in key priorities, between the need to rapidly build technical capacity to meet the demands of the DTO’s mission, and the need to build the administrative, management and governance processes required by a government entity. This split limited the DTO’s ability to operate to its full potential.

Nonetheless, throughout 2015–16, the DTO built capacity across both technical and corporate areas. This has allowed the agency to set the foundations for key program and organisational capability that will be built on in the year ahead.

{% include hx.html lvl=2 text="Report on financial performance" %}

The DTO recorded an operating surplus of $1.92 million for 2015–16. At 30 June 2016, the DTO had net equity of $5.4 million, representing $13.3 million of assets offset by $7.9 million of liabilities. The assets balance primarily relates to appropriation receivable of $9.3 million, while the majority of liabilities relate to suppliers payable of $5.9 million.

The DTO’s financial statements are presented in Part 4 of this annual report. The Australian National Audit Office issued an unmodified audit opinion of the statements on 16 September 2016. As 2015–16 was the first year of operation for the DTO, there are no comparative figures presented in the financial statements.

Tables 2 and 3 summarise the agency’s total resources and total expenses for the year.
