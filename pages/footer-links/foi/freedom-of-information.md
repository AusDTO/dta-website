<div class="lede">Under the <em>Freedom of Information Act 1982</em>, anyone can seek access to documents held by the Digital Transformation Office (DTO).</div>

## How to request access to documents
You must request access to documents in writing.

You should send FOI requests to:

[foi@digital.gov.au](mailto:foi@digital.gov.au)

You can also send FOI requests by mail to:

<ul class="postal-address">
<li>The FOI Coordinator</li>
<li>Digital Transformation Office</li>
<li>PO Box 457</li>
<li>CANBERRA ACT 2601</li>
</ul>

Your request must give us enough information about the documents you would like to access, to allow us to identify them.

We will not charge you a fee for making a request, but under the [*Freedom of Information Act 1982*](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02562), we can charge a fee for processing requests.

You can find more information about FOI on the website for the [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner](https://www.oaic.gov.au/).

## Information Publication Scheme
Under [section 8 of the *Freedom of Information Act 1982*](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00745/Html/Text#_Toc455577354), we must publish certain information on our website. This is called the Information Publication Scheme. We have sorted the information into categories that other government departments use, for consistency and ease of access.
