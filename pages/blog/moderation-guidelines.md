Thanks for visiting! We welcome your participation and contribution on [our blog](/blog/).

## Basic rules

We do ask that you observe some basic guidelines:

* Keep your comments on topic.
* Be respectful of others who use this website. Don’t use language that is offensive, inflammatory or provocative. This includes swearing, obscene or vulgar comments.
* Don’t break the law. This includes defamation, condoning illegal activity, breaching confidentiality or commercial-in-confidence, or comments that may be in contempt of court.
* Don’t use this site for political purposes. This website is paid for by public money, so it's inappropriate to engage in party-political activity.
* Don’t impersonate or falsely claim to represent a person or an organisation. If you use an obviously fake name or avatar, your comment will not be approved.
* Don’t use this blog to promote your business, products, service or publication unless clearly relevant to the discussion.

We moderate all comments to ensure they comply with these guidelines. 

## Here's a brief outline of how we evaluate your comments

### Has the comment clearly come from a ‘real person’?

If your comment is published under a name that’s clearly false, or looks like spam, it will not be published.

### Are you asking for information or detail relating to another DTA product?

We'll pass the query on and ensure it is dealt with as quickly as possible. If you provide an email address with your comment we'll update you directly on progress.

### Does the comment raise an issue with a tool or transaction? Or is it reporting a bug or performance problem?

We will alert the team responsible for fixing the issue and let you know this has been done.

### Is the comment on topic, helpful and constructive?

If your comment doesn't fit the topic of the blog post, don't post it, you should instead [contact the Digital Transformation Agency team](/contact/) who will help you with your query.

### If your comment doesn't meet the guidelines
Any comments that don’t meet these guidelines may not be published.
