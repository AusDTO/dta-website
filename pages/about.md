searchexcerpt: Our mission is to lead the transformation of government services to deliver a better experience for Australians.
---
The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) was established as an executive agency in July 2015 and is part of the Prime Minister’s portfolio.

Its mission is to lead the transformation of government services to deliver [a better experience for Australians](/blog/how-do-australians-really-feel-about-digital-government-services/).

In any given month, one in eight Australians aged 14 and over will look up government information and services online, totalling around 324 million transactions a year. Of these people, more than half will experience a problem.

When people can find the information and services they need online, they have a better service experience, with less impact on their time and lower cost to government.

Just as importantly, people shouldn’t need to understand how government is structured - and exactly which departments are responsible for each (part of a) service - in order to get the job done.

That’s why the Digital Transformation Office (or DTO) has been created - to work closely with government agencies, users and private sector partners [to create public services that are simpler, clearer and faster](http://www.slideshare.net/DTO-slides/ceda-presentation).
