      We're creating a new platform to make delivering and operating digital services easier.
    </p>
  </header>

  <ul class="timeline">
    <li>
      <h2>First services on the platform &mdash; February 2016</h2>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Self-service alpha expected &mdash; November/December 2016</h2>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    cloud.gov.au will make it easier to release, monitor and grow user-facing digital services.
    This will free up teams to focus on writing code to meet user needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    We're testing the platform with a small number of <a href="/our-work/transformation/">services in our delivery hubs</a>.
    We'll be opening this up to more services later in 2016.
