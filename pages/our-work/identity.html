  <p>Users should only need to establish their identity once when using different government services online. We're building an alpha of a service to verify the identity of individuals to a level that means they can access government services.</p>

  <p>We're also developing a Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) to make it easier for the DTO and other government agencies to work together.</p>
