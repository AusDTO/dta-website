    We've started work on a Digital Marketplace that will break down the barriers to technology procurement, making it easier for businesses - especially SMEs and start-ups - to help deliver digital services in government.
  </p>

  <p>Our work will focus on overhauling ICT procurement processes, building a strong customer base across government, creating a product catalogue, and developing the supplier ecosystem.</p>

  <p>This is being delivered as part of the <a href="http://innovation.gov.au/page/digital-marketplace">National Innovation and Science Agenda</a>.</p>
