title: Changes to the Digital Service Standard
permalink: /standard/changes-to-standard/
---
On 6 May 2016 the [Digital Service Standard](/standard) became live. This page details the changes between the Live version (13 criteria) and the Beta version (14 criteria).

The main changes are:

- a new criterion (6) about responsive design (previously in 9), common design patterns and style guide
- broadening the measurement requirements (updating 11)
- removing a criterion (14) about users succeeding first time unaided.

The [reasons for these changes to the Standard](/blog/standard-goes-live/) are discussed on the DTA blog.

You can read the [changes between the Alpha and Beta version of the Digital Service Standard](https://github.com/AusDTO/Digital-Service-Standard/commit/34baa753039c6a) on GitHub.
