The National e-Authentication Framework (NeAF) is a better practice approach to authenticating the identity of individual users and websites. The NeAF is intended for use by agencies at all levels of government as well as businesses working with government. The principles provide a foundation for building consistent authentication products.

The NeAF contains guidance on how to handle e-authentication as part of an agency's overall risk and identity management strategies. The NeAF explains how to use risk assessment to identify the required level of assurance, and the processes and technologies you need to use to achieve that level of assurance.

The objectives of the NeAF are to:

- ensure that approaches to e-authentication of identity balance the underlying risk with the need for ease of use on behalf of both parties
- enhance community confidence in electronic dealings with government agencies
- provide consistency in government processes for e-authentication of identity in order to increase efficiency and maximise the ease-of-use for all parties involved
- provide government agencies with the tools to determine the most appropriate approach to the e-authentication of identity
- ensure that due diligence is applied when determining these e-authentication approaches.
