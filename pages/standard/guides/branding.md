Australian Government transactional and information services, including websites and print publications, must use common branding.

There are many benefits to common branding:

*   Strengthened identity and visibility of the Australian Government’s digital presence.
*   Certainty for citizens that they are using an Australian Government service or website.
*   Reduced complexity of Australian Government structure through a simple memorable identity.

## Why must I?

Australian Government departments, agencies and other bodies' online and offline presence must comply with the [Australian Government Branding - Guidelines on the use of the Australian Government logo by Australian government departments and agencies](https://www.dpmc.gov.au/resource-centre/government/australian-government-branding-guidelines-use-australian-government-logo-australian-government-departments-and-agencies) unless granted an exemption, or permission to use a co-branded logo from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister through the [Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet](https://www.dpmc.gov.au/contact-us).

## How do I?

*   [Download the correct template](#download)
*   [Refer correctly to the Australian Government in content](#refercorrectly)
*   [Check guidance on common uses](#checkguidance)

### <a id="download" name="download"></a>Download the correct template

The files are provided in Adobe Photoshop 6.0/Adobe Image Ready 3.0 formats as zipped PSD files, with each element on its own layer, and all type and colour fully editable. The size, leading, tracking/kerning of the typeface and the dimensions between the primary elements of the Design should not be modified. Times New Roman is the only typeface font that can be used for all versions of the Design.

> The smallest version of the logos (32 pixels) must not be used on websites and may only be used when available space is limited (for example, mobile applications).

![example of cobranded logo](/images/standard/cobranded-design.jpg)

> Where the Design is used as a navigational element (for example, functioning as a link to the agency's home page) the alt text should alternatively describe the destination of the link:
>
>* If the Design is primarily for government and agency branding (most situations), then the alt text should be the agency name​.
>* If the Design is the only link to the agency's home page, then the alt text should be '[agency name] home'.​                                                                                                                                                                                             

### <a id="refercorrectly" name="refercorrectly"></a>Refer correctly to the Australian Government in content

Where the term ‘Commonwealth Government’ or ‘Federal Government’ was used, you should replace it with ‘Australian Government’. When discussing Australian Government agencies you should write the ‘Australian Government Department of XYZ’. Do not use the past reference the ‘Commonwealth Department of XYZ’.

The ‘Commonwealth of Australia’ is the legal entity established by the Constitution. It is sometimes referred to simply as ‘the Commonwealth’. You should only use ‘Commonwealth of Australia’ or ‘the Commonwealth’ to describe the entity established by the Constitution, such as in a legal context, or in a geographic sense.

There is more guidance on [preferred terminology](/standard/design-guides/online-writing/#usepreferred) available.

#### Amending old content

Content published prior to June 2003 should only be amended to reflect this guidance if it describes the agencies’ current functions or responsibilities, current programs and policies.

Do not change the following content for previous years:

*   annual reports
*   media releases
*   publications that have been tabled in Parliament
*   previous policy or program documents
*   financial statements
*   documents describing agencies' legal entity or legislation
*   anything that alters the official record.

### <a id="checkguidance" name="checkguidance"></a>Guidance on common uses

#### Agency websites

The Agency Design should appear at the top left of every page of an agency website. If desired, the Design can be used as a navigational element to link to the agency's homepage.

For example: [Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet](https://www.dpmc.gov.au/)

#### Product/policy/program websites

Program branding which includes a specific logo may be located on sites in conjunction with an appropriately implemented version of the Design.

##### The Australian Government Design

Agencies have the option of using the Agency Design, the ‘An Australian Government Initiative’ Design or the Australian Government Design. Agencies should ensure consistency between digital and print products.

The chosen Design should appear at the top left of every page. If desired, the Design can be used as a navigational element to link to the home page.

##### Program/product/policy logo or title

The size and placement of the program/product/policy logo or title of the site should not compromise the hierarchy of the Design.

For example:

*   [At Ease](http://at-ease.dva.gov.au/)
*   [Family Relationships Online](http://www.familyrelationships.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx)
*   [Commonwealth Budget](http://www.budget.gov.au/)

#### Ministerial websites

The [Australian Government Branding - Guidelines on the use of the Australian Government logo by Australian government departments and agencies](https://www.dpmc.gov.au/resource-centre/government/australian-government-branding-guidelines-use-australian-government-logo-australian-government-departments-and-agencies) requires that there be a clear distinction between agency websites and ministerial websites. Ministerial sites should not include the Australian Government Design or the Agency Design; however the [Commonwealth Coat of Arms](http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/coat-arms/index.cfm) may be used.

For example: [Minister for Finance](http://www.financeminister.gov.au/)

#### Mobile websites

The same principles of applying government branding should be followed wherever possible. That is, the appropriate logo should be applied to every page in a size and placement that does not compromise the integrity of the logo.

Where it is not practical to apply the branding according to the instruction already outlined, the content should include the appropriate text alternative that is applied to the Design.

#### Mobile applications

The same principles of applying government branding should be followed wherever possible. That is, the appropriate logo should be applied to the landing or splash page in a size and placement that does not compromise the integrity of the logo.

#### Intranets

The Agency Design should be applied to intranet sites. Placement is at the discretion of the agency; the top-left is recommended.

#### eNewsletters, digital versions of forms and digital brochures

Agencies should use the appropriate Design in a size that does not compromise the integrity of the Design. Where a plain text version of the email newsletter/alert is provided, the words 'Australian Government' should be incorporated in a prominent position.

On all forms, agencies should use the appropriate Design in a size and placement that does not compromise the integrity of the Design.

#### Non-government websites

Agencies may find they have a need to be involved with cross-jurisdictional initiatives or websites outside the gov.au domain either through a sponsorship agreement or entering into a collaborative arrangement.

Appropriate branding needs to be considered. Agencies should negotiate to use the Design in the most appropriate place on the site that recognises the Australian Government's involvement, without compromising the intention of the initiative. This ensures a balanced recognition for the Australian Government and its partners.

For example:

- Cross-jurisdictional: [Energy Efficiency Exchange](http://eex.gov.au/about-us/)
- Non-government: [Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet](http://www.healthinfonet.ecu.edu.au/)
