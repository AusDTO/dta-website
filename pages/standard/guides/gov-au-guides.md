## What are these guides?

The GOV.AU Guides are currently under development. Once released, the guides will share the latest thinking in accessibility, best-practice and user-tested design and content approaches.

The guides will:

- help designers, developers and content writers and editors to create and maintain a consistent and simple user experience across Australian Government online services
- support the building of services which are inclusive by design
- help government departments and agencies apply a consistent visual style, voice and tone. This will help users recognise government information as a trusted source of truth.
- respond to user-needs by inviting feedback as it develops and evolves. Once live, information will be continually updated and designers, researchers, content creators and front-end developers will be invited to comment, collaborate, share and discuss ideas.

## What will be in the guides?

### Prototype toolkit, design components and code

Global styles, colour, typography, forms, icon usage, buttons, interface patterns, support documents, content type templates, foundations for a consistent visual language and open source code.

### Guidance, examples and code

Showing how to create a streamlined experience for people who engage with government on different screen sizes and devices.

### Contextual information for using patterns and components

To help users understand the why and how, accessibility guidance and usability considerations.

### A modern content style guide (A to Z format) and writing for the web guidance

Style guidance and examples to help writers and editors create simpler, clearer, accessible digital content.
