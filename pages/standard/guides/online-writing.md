This guide provides advice on how to write content for users of services in [scope of the Digital Service Standard](/standard/scope-of-standard/). It may also be helpful for internal communication channels, such as an intranet, however it is written with external service content in mind.

## Why must I?

Digital services need clear and easy-to-understand content to help people find and use the information they require. By writing in plain English and using consistent spelling, grammar, tone and structure we make services easier to use. Clear content also means it's easier for people to keep using digital services independently without having to phone government or visit us in person.

While we recommend plain English as the default, this style is not going to work for every user. That’s why we suggest this rule of thumb: **make communication as simple as its users need**. One group of users may need similar information to another, but in much greater detail. In certain circumstances your user research may tell you that you need to write the same content twice: one version for a general audience and another for technical users.

The Australian Government is committed to [making its websites more accessible](/standard/design-guides/making-content-accessible) through conformance with the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) at AA level, and AAA level for certain websites.

The standard style references for Australian Government are:

*   [_Macquarie Dictionary_](https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/).

Some of the guidance provided in this article for digital content varies from that which is provided in the _Style manual for authors, editors and printers_. These differences are noted in this guide.

### <a id="structure" name="structure"></a>Structure content

#### Identify the aim

It is difficult to write information for your audience if its purpose is unclear. Identify the aim of your content to determine the level of detail required. Focus on _how_ the user should do something, rather than telling them _about_ something. Make calls to action clear and simple.

#### Use headings

Headings are signposts in text and navigational aids. Readers use headings to scan content and to gauge the relationship between and importance of sections of text.

##### Limit levels

Content should only have 1 top level (H1) heading. Be careful with the number of headings added beyond this. Readers will lose track if there are too many heading levels. Short content should only use 2 extra subheading levels (H2 and H3). Longer content might require more (H4s and maybe H5s).

##### Pace usage

To aid readability and comprehension, use headings to break up text and draw in the reader.

To support both navigation and access, use a heading at least every 200 words or so (every 2 to 4 paragraphs).

##### Be interesting

Make headings specific enough to catch the reader’s attention. You should either provide information or raise a query. Avoid meaningless words for headings such as _general_, _miscellaneous_, _other_, or _more_.

##### Keep short

Try to limit headings to less than 1 line. Headings that spill over to a second line are harder to read and to recall.

#### Chunk in paragraphs

A paragraph is a section of text that contains a single idea.

State your idea in the first sentence. This will attract your reader’s attention and get your message across. Readers often scan headings and first sentences of paragraphs as they search for the information they want.

##### Vary length

Structure your paragraphs so they range in length from 1 to 4 sentences.

If appropriate to the content, vary the length of paragraph to provide variety. This makes content more interesting and readable.

##### Use simple sentences

Use short sentences that contain a single message. If you need to communicate other messages  use a second sentence, commas or brackets.

Vary the length of your sentences to make content less tiring to read. For many people comprehension can start to fail after 25 to 30 words, so this should be the limit of your longest sentences.

#### Break up content with lists

If you have long sentences with many elements, use a list to break up the text and make it easier for your reader to understand and scan.

Use bullet lists by default. You should only use numbers or letters when it is necessary to show a priority order or chronology.

There are 4 types of lists

*   [Sentence fragments](#sentence)
*   [Full sentences](#fullsentences)
*   [Stand-alone items](#standalone)
*   [Nested lists](#nested)

##### <a id="sentence" name="sentence"></a>Sentence fragments

The most common type of bulleted list comprises a series of sentence fragments. The list items should flow logically from a common introduction (the first part of the sentence).

>**For example:**
>
>_A sentence fragment list should:_
>
>*   _contain at least 2 items_
>*   _flow neatly from the introduction_
>*   _end with a full stop._

Each item in your list must make sense when read directly from the introduction. For instance, if there is a verb at the beginning of the first bulleted point, you need a verb at the beginning of all the others too, such as _identifying_, _rewriting_ and _structuring_.

>**For example:**
>
> _Parallel structure in a fragmented list requires:_
>
>*   _identifying items that can be collected into a list_
>*   _rewriting items so they are not sentences in their own right_
>*   _structuring items to have the same kind of start, such as_
>	*   _nouns like ‘cat’_
>	*   _verbs like ‘read’_
>	*   _adjectives like ‘quick’._

Don’t include a full sentence within an item in a fragmented list. This destroys parallel structure, making the list difficult to understand. If the full sentence is necessary, the information is not suitable for list structure and needs to be rewritten.

If a list, or part of a list, consists of a single item it should be rewritten as a sentence, or reworked as part of the previous item that led into it.

For sentence fragment lists use a lower-case first letter for each item, and no punctuation at the end of any item except the last, which has a full stop.

##### <a id="fullsentences" name="fullsentences"></a>Full sentences

Lists made up of items that are full sentences are less common. This kind of list may be introduced by a full sentence, but more often by a sentence fragment.

>**For example:**
>
>_Plain English is important for a number of reasons including:_
>
>*   _We can never be sure how much background information a reader will have so it’s important not to make assumptions in our writing._
>*   _Often we will have to revise content. If the original content is written in plain English it will be much easier to revise than dense technical text._

For full sentence lists use normal sentence punctuation; a capital first letter at the beginning and a full stop at the end of each item.

##### <a id="standalone" name="standalone"></a>Stand-alone items

Stand-alone lists run straight off a heading. The items are generally shopping list-style: a series of unrelated, typically short items that do not integrate easily into normal text or are more easily understood in list form. The structure of the ‘How do I?’ section in guides is an example of a stand-alone item list.

>**For example:**
>
>_Writing for the web_
>
>*   _Identify the aim of the content_
>*   _Work out the best format_
>*   _Edit and proofread_

For stand-alone lists there is no colon after the introductory heading (applying minimal punctuation in headings) and no punctuation at the end of any item, including the last item. Start each list item with a capital first letter.

##### <a id="nested" name="nested"></a>Nested lists

For nested lists use a lower-case first letter to start each item. There is no punctuation at the end of any item, unless the last item is also the end of the entire list, in which case there is a full stop.

>**For example:**
>
>_When writing for the web be sure to:_
>
>*   _identify the aim of the content_
>*   _work out the best format_
>*   _edit and proofread your work by checking for_
>	*   _spelling and punctuation errors_
>	*   _factual accuracy._

Don’t use a colon at the end of an item leading into a sub-list (if the list returned to a running sentence there would be no temptation to do this as it would look incorrect).

### <a id="usepreferred" name="usepreferred"></a>Use preferred terms

### <a id="writeplain" name="writeplain"></a>Write in plain English

Plain English is the difference between this:

_We are working to make your job easier by giving you access to communicate with us electronically through a new service provider view of our online portal._ (27 words)

and this:

_The new service provider view of the portal makes it easier for you to communicate with us._ (17 words)

You should use the language that is appropriate to your audience. Generally this should be plain English, however there may be a business case for including technical or legal language. This may mean you will need to write the same content in a different way for a different user base. The rule is to make language as simple as its users need.

There is lots of guidance on how to write in plain English:

*   [Plain Language Australia](http://www.plainlanguageaustralia.com/)
*   [Plain English Foundation](https://www.plainenglishfoundation.com/)
*   [Plain Language Action and Information Network’s guide to simple words and phrases](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/wordsuggestions/simplewords.cfm)

#### Write in active voice

A sentence is in the _active voice_ when the agent of the action (that is, the person or thing doing something) appears in front of the verb.

>**For example:**
>
>John Smith (agent) ate (verb) the grape (target).

This sentence shows you clearly and immediately who is doing the action.

A sentence is in the _passive voice_ when the target of the verb appears in front of the verb.

>**For example:**
>
>The grape (target) was eaten (verb) by John Smith (agent).  

Active voice clearly identifies who is doing what to whom, is more immediate and generally uses fewer words. Try using the first and second person instead of the third person to help you to write in the active voice.

#### Personalise content

Make your content more personal by using the first and second person pronouns _I_, _we_, _us_ and _you_ rather than third-person nouns (such as _Australian Government Department of Finance_) and pronouns (_he_, _she_, _it_ and _they_).

Instead of:

_If the author is having difficulty creating content using markdown, the web policy team can provide further guidance._

Write:

_If you are having difficulty creating content using markdown, we can provide further guidance._

#### Be inclusive

Language is discriminatory if it:

*   excludes people or makes them invisible to the reader
*   focuses on a single characteristic to the exclusion of other more relevant ones
*   stereotypes people
*   insults or denigrates people
*   treats some people differently from others.

Use gender-neutral job titles:

*   _worker_ instead of _workman_
*   _business manager_ or _business person_ instead of _business man_ or _business woman_
*   _chairperson_ instead of _chairman_ or _chairwoman_.

Avoid using gender-specific singular pronouns (_he/she_, _her/his_, _her/him_) by rewriting the sentence.

For example: instead of "Every employee should fill out his employment declaration" write "Every employee should fill out an employment declaration".

##### Writing about disability

*   Refer to ‘people with disability’ (singular). Similarly, use ‘hearing impaired’ and ‘visually impaired’
*   Avoid expressions such as ‘handicapped’, ‘deaf’ or ‘blind’
*   Avoid using patronising or demeaning phrases such as ‘crippled’ or ‘wheelchair bound’
*   Do not use labels or stereotypes such as ‘the disabled’, ‘the deaf’ or ‘the blind’
*   Do not put people with disability on a pedestal or talk about them in patronising terms as if they are performing normal or everyday activities exceptionally
*   Refer to adults with disability in the same way you would refer to any other adult. Do not refer to them by their first name where in similar circumstances you would use a title such as Mr, Ms or Doctor
*   Refer to older people as ‘older people’, ‘senior citizens’ or ‘seniors’, not ‘pensioners’, ‘old-age pensioners’ or ‘the aged’
*   When referring to people who are too old to be called children but who are not yet adults, use ‘young people’ rather than ‘youth’ or ‘juveniles’.

##### Culturally and linguistically diverse audiences

When referring to people who have come to Australia from non-English speaking countries, use ‘people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds’ (CALD).

When preparing content for CALD audiences, you should recognise cultural diversity and specific needs while not stereotyping or making assumptions.

Things to consider when writing content for CALD audiences:

*   values and rules about sincerity and politeness
*   religious affiliations
*   generational differences
*   gender roles
*   values or philosophical differences
*   political impacts on life events
*   pre and post effects of wars
*   differences in educational levels and systems
*   perceptions of social and support concepts
*   differences in socioeconomic background.

There is more information on writing for CALD audiences in the [designing inclusive services guide](/standard/design-guides/inclusive-services/).

##### Indigenous Australian audiences

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander audiences come from a diverse range of places and backgrounds. For many, English may be a second language and written English may be difficult to understand so you should be extra careful that your writing tone and style suits the audience.

Use correct terminology

*   Don’t try to mirror Aboriginal English
*   When talking about (or to) an individual or a group of individuals the preferred term is ‘Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people’ or ‘peoples’. The term ‘Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Australians’ isn’t preferred
*   The term ‘Indigenous’ should be avoided when referring to individuals who are ‘Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people’ or ‘peoples’
*   The terms ‘Aboriginal’ and ‘Torres Strait Islander’, if used, are written in title case
*   ‘And/or’ must be used instead of just ‘or’ to reflect the diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage. When a shorter version is needed, for example on a publication cover or online menus, this term can be abbreviated to ‘Indigenous Australians’
*   Don’t use ‘Australian Aborigine’ or the acronym ‘ATSI’
*   ‘Indigenous’ is the preferred term when referring to a business entity or business function, for example Indigenous Specialist Officer, Indigenous Services Branch

There is more information on writing for Indigenous Australian audiences in [designing inclusive services](/standard/design-guides/inclusive-services/).

### <a id="useminimal" name="useminimal"></a>Use minimal punctuation

Limit punctuation to only what is needed to aid comprehension and balance ease of reading and clarity of message. It is easier for a user to read several short sentences than a long sentence broken up with punctuation.

#### Apostrophes

The apostrophe’s role is to indicate:

*   possession
*   missing letters or characters in two-word contractions.

The following words are often incorrectly punctuated.

| Correct | Incorrect  | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **It’s** an easy step to take.  | **Its** an easy step to take. | _It’s_ is the contraction of _it is_. |
| The government launched **its** new information package. | The government launched **it’s** new information package  | _Its_ is the possessive pronoun (belonging to it).  |
| **Who’s** the right person? | **Whose** the right person? | _Who’s_ is the contraction of _who is_.  |
| **Whose** is this? | **Who’s** is this? | _Whose_: the possessive pronoun (belonging to whom?).  |
| It’s **your** choice | It’s **you’re** choice. | _Your_: the possessive pronoun (belonging to you). |
| **You’re** right about it. | **Your** right about it. | _You’re_: the contraction of _you are_. |
| These are **their** words. | These are **they’re** words. | _Their_: the possessive pronoun (belonging to them).  |
| **They’re** all over there.  | **Their** all over there.  | _They’re_: the contraction of _they are_.  |
| The documents are over **there**. | The documents are over **their**. | _There_: in or at a particular place. |

See also the [UK Plain English Campaign’s guide to using apostrophes](http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/using-apostrophes.html).

##### Possession

To show possession you add an apostrophe and the letter ‘s’ to the noun, in that order, including names and singular nouns that end with an ‘s’. The exception is plural common nouns ending with an ‘s’, to which we add only an apostrophe.

>**For example:**
>
>* _The Commissioner’s column, OCTC’s main role, Dickens’s novels_ (proper nouns, names).
>* _The builder’s tax return, the business line’s delivery plan_ (singular common nouns).
>* _The people’s responses to the survey, the children’s applications_ (plural common nouns not ending in ‘s’).
>* _Field workers’ particular problems, the agencies’ budgets, several employers’ obligations, your clients’ reporting requirements_ (plural common nouns ending in ‘s’).

Don't use an apostrophe:

*	in contractions of single words: _govt, Cwlth, dept_
*	in possessive pronouns: _the car is yours, mine, and ours_
*  in expressions that are more descriptive than possessive: _directors fees, senior citizens club_
*	on the plural form of an initialism: _CTPs, TFNs, CDs_
*   in references to decades: _1990s, 1960s_
*   in place names: _the Geographical Names Board abolished apostrophes in Australian place names in 1966_.

##### Two-word contractions

When 2 adjacent words are contracted into 1 you use an apostrophe to show that letters have been omitted.

*   _don’t_ (do not)
*   _we’re_ (we are)
*   _they’re_ (they are)
*   _they’ve_ (they have)
*   _we’ll_ (we will)
*   _it’s_ (it is).

Avoid using should’ve, could’ve, would’ve, and so forth. as these contractions are difficult to read.

### <a id="writenumbers" name="writenumbers"></a>Write numbers consistently

To balance consistency and readability, write:

*   single-digit and multi-digit numbers in numerals: _1_ to _9_, and from _10_ up to _999,999_
*   a million or greater in a combination of figures and words: _235 million_.

Also use numerals when the number is:

*   part of a measurement, date, time or temperature: _5 kg, 7 July, 50 KB_
*   preceded or followed by a symbol, for example: _$2, 75%_
*   used as part of a numbering sequence: _Step 1, Requirement 7, Rule 4._

>This guidance differs from the recommendation of the _[Style manual for authors, editors and printers (6th edition)](http://www.australia.gov.au/publications/style-manual)_. We know from [eye-tracking research](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-writing-show-numbers-as-numerals/) that users read differently when content is on the screen compared to on a printed page (generally they scan the page, rather than read it from top to bottom). It is quicker for users to read a number than a word when consuming content on a screen.

### <a id="linkother" name="linkother"></a>Link to other content

To link to external content create a hyperlink with an accurate description of the content as as the link text.

>**For example:**
>
>Refer to the [_Macquarie Dictionary_'s definitions](https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/) for the correct spelling.

Always link to online services first. Offer offline alternatives afterwards (where possible).

To link to files, such as PDF or DOCX, add the format and the size of the file in brackets within the link.

>**For example:**
>
> The [Digital Service Standard poster (PDF 83 KB)](/files/DTO_Digital-Service-Standard_CRITERIA-A4_August 2016.pdf).

### <a id="proofread" name="proofread"></a>Proofread

The aim of proofreading is to ensure there are no inconsistencies or mistakes within the content before it is published. Extensive changes should not be made to your content at the proofreading stage. The insertion of new content at this stage can be time consuming, and can produce new and potentially embarrassing mistakes.

#### Check spelling and punctuation

You should use standard Australian spelling. The [_Macquarie Dictionary_](https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/) is the standard reference guide.

Computer spelling and grammar checkers are useful aids but they don’t replace the need for careful manual checking. In particular, these tools do not recognise correctly spelt words that appear in the wrong context, such as ‘font’ and ‘front’, ‘form’ and ‘from’, ‘public’ and ‘pubic’, ‘practice’ and ‘practise’, and ‘contract’ and ‘contact’.

Always spell the name of an individual or organisation the way they spell it, such as _World Health Organization_ (with a _z_).

##### Americanisms

Avoid using Americanisms, unless the American spelling or term is the commonly accepted online usage.

>**For example:**
>
>*   You _fill in_ a form_,_ not _fill out_ a form.
>*   Use the _ise_ rather than _ize_ suffix, that is _organise_ not _organize._
>*   _Shopping cart_ is the commonly used term for online shopping rather than _shopping trolley_.

The default Microsoft Word spell checker setting is US English, which differs from Australian English (for instance, in the spelling of words ending in _ise_, where the American version uses _ize_).

#### Keep style consistent

If you are producing content across a number of sources, be sure to check your style is consistent across them all.

In particular, check:

*   content is readable and not overly complex with long paragraphs
*   headings, fonts and layout are correct
*   language is appropriate to the audience
*   hyperlinks and cross-references are accurately presented.
