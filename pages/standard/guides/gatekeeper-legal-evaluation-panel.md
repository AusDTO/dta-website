The role of the members of the Gatekeeper Legal Evaluation Panel is to evaluate the legal documents for organisations applying for Gatekeeper Accreditation and Service Providers amending previously approved legal documents submit, as part of their documentation suite.

## Documents evaluated

### PO 01 Certificate Policy (except for Special Category)

A CP (a public document) describes the conditions that are attached to the use and application of certificates.

It is a named set of rules that indicates the applicability of a certificate to a particular community and/or class of application with common security requirements. It also documents the CAs policies with respect to issues such as: obligations/ responsibilities of participants, liability, financial arrangements, confidentiality, intellectual property and privacy.

This document is evaluated against RFC 3647 Internet X.509 CP and CPS Framework, *Privacy Act 1988* (Cth) and *Archives Act 1983* (Cth).

### PO 02 Certification Practice Statement

A CPS (a public document) is a statement of the practices that a CA employs in managing the certificates it issues and includes both legal and technical issues. A CA with a single CPS may support multiple Certificate Policies (used for different application purposes and/or different certificate user communities). It is possible that different CA's with non-identical CPS's may support the same certificate policy.

This document is evaluated against RFC 3647 Internet X.509 CP and CPS Framework, *Privacy Act 1988* (Cth) and *Archives Act 1983* (Cth).

### PO1a End User Agreement (except for Special Category)

Subscriber and Relying Party Agreements should contain a summarised plain English version of the terms and conditions set out in the CPS and relevant CP.
