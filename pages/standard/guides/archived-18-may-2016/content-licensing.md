>**Legislative requirement:** Copyright is a type of legal protection for people who express ideas and information in certain original forms and is administered under the Commonwealth’s [_Copyright Act 1968_](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00146) (Copyright Act). The most common forms are writing, visual images, music, films, broadcasts, computer programs and moving images.

Copyright owners have certain exclusive rights in relation to their material. These rights include making copies of the material, publishing the material for the first time, and communicating the material (for example, via email or the internet).

Generally, it is an infringement of copyright to use a copyright owner’s material in these ways without permission unless an exception applies. The Australian Government is permitted to use whatever copyright material it needs to for [official purposes](https://www.communications.gov.au/policy/policy-listing/government-use-copyright-material). The Copyright Act also contains exceptions which include fair dealing for the purposes of research, study, criticism, review, reporting news, etc.

## Provide a copyright notice

Agencies must include appropriate copyright notices on their websites. For an example, see the Australian Government [Attorney-General’s Department](http://www.ag.gov.au/Pages/Copyright.aspx)’s website.

## Use open licensing by default

>**Legislative requirement:** The [_Statement of Intellectual Property Principles for Australian Government Agencies_](https://www.communications.gov.au/policy/policy-listing/australian-government-intellectual-property-rules) was amended so, from October 2010, agencies are encouraged to use open licences when releasing public sector information (PSI). PSI includes all materials which agencies are generally obliged to publish or otherwise allow free public access to.

Under the amended principles, agencies are encouraged to license PSI under a [Creative Commons BY standard](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/) by default, and only use more restrictive licences after a process of due diligence and on a case-by-case basis. The Creative Commons licence helps users to copy, distribute, transmit and adapt material for commercial and non-commercial purposes with the correct attribution.
