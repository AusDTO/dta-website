The Australian Government is undertaking a long-term program of reviewing in-person interactions across government shopfronts and telephony channels. This is to support the transition to a digital channel for most individual and business dealings with government.

By designing digital services that are consistent and simple to use, we will reduce the need for users to visit a shopfront or contact government by phone. The [Digital Service Standard](/standard/) will improve government information and services, encouraging users to choose digital in preference to other channels.

Offline interactions are also a key part of providing [assisted digital](/standard/design-guides/assisted-digital/) support to users moving to digital interaction with government.

## Integrating services

The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) is working with agencies to review in-person interactions. This includes outreach, shopfront and telephony activities. We need to ensure these channels are complementary to one another and support the transition to easy, simple and consistent digital offerings.

The DTO will support agencies to:

*   improve the consistency and cohesiveness of digital information and services, including consolidating websites to a smaller number of user-focused sites
*   identify where people struggle across all channels when interacting with government, and design digital services that overcome these issues using whole-of-government [analytics](/standard/design-guides/analytics-tools/) and [user research](/standard/design-guides/user-research/)
*   ensure digital services are accessible and usable
*   use latest technology to provide additional services such as progress tracking and reminders
*   provide online and offline support to users to assist them to use a digital channel and continue to provide services where digital may not be appropriate
*   provide smooth transition between the various interaction channels when users are required to, or need to, shift between digital and off-line channels.

## Developing the integration strategy

The DTO is developing an approach to ensure the seamless integration, or connection, of government agencies to provide services (offline and online) that are aligned to the complete user journey. In developing this approach, we will focus on user needs rather than agency requirements. In moving towards a more connected government, the pace and order of change are key factors. This integration strategy will enable multiple government agencies to work together to better service users, helping to reduce the complexity of government.

We encourage you to <a class="feedbackTrigger" href="mailto:jira@ausdto.atlassian.net?subject=Contact%20us%20about%20Building%20digital%20services">provide input</a> in to the integration strategy.
