>**Legislative requirement:** Under the [_Freedom of Information Act 1982_](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/foia1982222/) (FOI Act) every person has the right to access information held by the Australian Government and its authorities. Most Australian Government agencies are subject to the FOI Act; however there are certain security intelligence and defence intelligence agencies that are exempt. There are also certain documents that are exempt from access to ensure that sensitive information, including personal, secret or national security information is properly protected. The FOI Act extends to paper and electronic records.

## Requests under the FOI Act

The FOI Act requires Australian Government agencies to:

*   provide access to documents in their possession unless the document is within an exception or exemption specified in the legislation
*   consider proactively publishing other government information
*   publish, in a disclosure log, information that has been released in response to an access request. This requirement also applies to Ministers
*   provide details of an officer (or officers) who can be contacted about access to the agency’s information or documents under the FOI Act.

### Access requests

Agencies and ministers must acknowledge receipt of an FOI request within 14 days. If an FOI request does not meet the requirements set out in Section 15(2) of the FOI Act, an agency has an obligation to assist the applicant to make a valid request. Agencies and ministers must also provide an estimate of the relevant charges as soon as possible. There are no charges for an individual’s request for their own personal information.

### Disclosure log

Agencies and ministers must publish information released under an access request within 10 working days of giving the FOI applicant access to the information (Section 11C of the FOI Act), unless the information is of a type that would be unreasonable to publish. This requirement also commenced on 1 May 2011.

The [FOI guidelines](http://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information/applying-the-foi-act/foi-guidelines/) issued by the OAIC, under Section 93A of the FOI Act, assist agencies to meet their FOI obligations. Agencies must consider these guidelines when they are performing a function or exercising a power under the FOI Act.

Other [FOI guidance and resources](http://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information/foi-resources/freedom-of-information-agency-resources/) are available from the Office of the Information Commissioner.

## <a id="IPS" name="IPS"></a>Information Publication Scheme

The [Information Publication Scheme](https://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information/foi-act#the-information-publication-scheme) (IPS) applies to Australian Government agencies that are subject to the FOI Act.

The IPS encourages agencies to proactively release information in a consistent way, reflecting the pro-disclosure goals of the FOI Act. It requires all Australian Government agencies to publish several categories of information including details of the agency’s structure and functions, and [information regularly provided to parliament](https://www.dpmc.gov.au/resource-centre/government/guidelines-presentation-documents-parliament), as well as a plan of how it complies with the IPS requirements.
