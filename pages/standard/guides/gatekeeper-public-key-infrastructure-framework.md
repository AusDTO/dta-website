The Gatekeeper Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Framework governs the use of digital keys and certificates by the Australian Government to assure the identity of subscribers to authentication services. Subscribers can include individual users, organisations and non-human devices, such as applications and computers.

The Framework sets out the requirements for organisations to become accredited to issue digital keys and certificates for use in government for PKI-based authentication.

> **Policy requirement**: the Gatekeeper PKI Framework states Australian Government agencies must only use digital keys and certificates issued by a Gatekeeper-accredited organisation for PKI authentication.

Gatekeeper accreditation covers the issuing of digital keys and certificates to subscribers that need to work in:

- open environments, such as the internet
- closed environments, such as communities of interest
- hybrid communities.

Providers are assessed by Information Security Registered Assessor Program (IRAP) assessors. The services are audited by IRAP assessors annually to ensure compliance with the Gatekeeper PKI Framework.

If you are contracted by a service provider to undertake an IRAP assessment you can request a service providerâ€™s list of approved documents by contacting [authentication@dta.gov.au](mailto:authentication@dta.gov.au)
