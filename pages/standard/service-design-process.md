We will design public services for Australians in user-centered and iterative ways. This helps teams to start small and learn fast, and to create services that can be delivered quickly and to save money by reducing service failure.

The service design and delivery process has 4 stages: 

<div class="design-and-delivery-process">
<ol class="list-horizontal">

<li>
  <article>
    <h2>Discovery</h2>
    <p>Start mapping the broader service landscape, researching the real needs and problems faced by your users, and understanding the policy intent and technology constraints.</p>
    <p><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/discovery/">Learn about the Discovery stage</a></p>
    <p><a href="http://ausdto.github.io/service-handbook/discovery/">Read the Discovery guide</a></p>
  </article>
</li>

<li>
  <article>
    <h2 class="phase-heading">Alpha</h2>
    <p>Test out your hypotheses by building prototypes in code to explore different ways you might be able to meet your users&rsquo; needs. Explore multiple ideas. Do user research to learn which approach works best and iterate your solution as you learn more.</p>

  </article>
</li>

<li>
  <article>
    <h2 class="phase-heading">Beta</h2>
    <p>Define a minimum viable product from the successful prototype in Alpha. Build this as an accessible and secure service. Allow the public to trial the beta alongside the existing service. Use their feedback to improve the service.</p>
  </article>
</li>

<li>
  <article>
    <h2 class="phase-heading">Live</h2>
    <p>Put the team and processes in place to continue operating and improving the service. Phasing out the old services, and consolidating existing non‑digital channels.</p>
  </article>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
