breadcrumb: 7. Use open standards and common platforms
searchexcerpt: "Using open standards and common government platforms helps you to meet the needs of your users by building with proven solutions; make users’ experience of government more consistent, which generates trust; save time and money by reusing things that are already available; be more efficient by sharing data appropriately and move between different technologies when you need to, avoiding vendor lock-in."

## Why it’s in the Standard
Using [open standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard) and common government platforms helps you to:

* meet the needs of your users by building with proven solutions
* make users’ experience of government more consistent, which generates trust
* save time and money by reusing things that are already available
* be more efficient by sharing data appropriately
* move between different technologies when you need to, avoiding vendor lock-in.

## How you'll be assessed
During Alpha you should understand what open standards and common platforms can be used for your service. You should:

* build using the open standards of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop prototypes
* follow government better practice and standards in the design of the service
* identify tools, systems, processes that can be adopted or reused from other services
* search for similar solutions in other jurisdictions.

During Beta and as you go live you should continue applying government solutions while also:

* building using the [Open Web Platform standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/)
* avoiding lock-in to any proprietary solutions where an open standard is available
* addressing any common user needs in a way that is consistent with the rest of government.
