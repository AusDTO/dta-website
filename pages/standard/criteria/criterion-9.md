## Why it’s in the Standard

You need to make sure everyone who needs your service can use it. This includes people with disabilities and older people, and people who can’t use, or struggle with, digital services.

Your service must be accessible to users regardless of their digital confidence and access to a digital environment. This includes users in remote areas and users’ different  devices.

## How you'll be assessed

During the [Discovery stage](/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/discovery/) you will have developed a good understanding of how your users may access your service. To make sure everyone will be able to use your service you need to show:

- the type of environments users may access the service in, including with different browsers and desktop and mobile devices, and when connections are slower and there may be limited data; for example, through user stories
- diversity in research recruitment and targeted users, including people from different cultural backgrounds and people with disability 
- consideration of situational and environmental limitations that affect a user's ability to access the product
- the plan to meet accessibility requirements in the design of the product, for example how it will meet [WCAG 2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag)
- what digital assistance might be needed to support users; for example web chat, telephone assistance, face-to-face, clear instructions, checklists, and so on.

During the Alpha stage, you should be able to show: 

- your prototypes can accommodate users from different backgrounds and users with disability
- any accessibility issues and barriers that might need addressing in the Beta stage
- you have access to facilities to perform testing on various devices or platforms, for example a plan for testing.

During the Beta stage you will be developing your service and you must ensure accessibility requirements and needs of all your users are being met.

You will need to show:

- iteration in the design and content of your service to meet accessibility requirements and improve usability for people with disability 
- non-digital access and support for people unable to use, or struggling with, the digital service
- end-to-end user journeys, including assisted digital journeys, and demonstrate that they work and how you tested them
- how you’ve included cultural and linguistically diverse communities in your design
- a plan to include translation for non-English speaking audiences, as appropriate 
- you have testing environments, systems and approaches for non-digital parts of the service (including assisted digital routes); for example, a testing plan
- how the service will perform under expected loads (including assisted digital routes)
- strong understanding of the environments your users may access the service in, for example which browsers, desktop and mobile devices they will use, and which remote locations; you might use user stories and a journey map to show this
- definition of supported browsers and devices, and how they are accommodated
- any barriers to the digital service and its content on mobile devices, and plans to address them
- the design requirements for users using a mobile device and other identified environments, for example design specifications
- how you have tested for the users’ ability to complete all digital transactions on supported devices and platforms
- detail of users’ interactions with the product during testing
- a demonstration your service in a live-like environment
- the majority of users can access the service in their environment.

As you go live you will need to show:

- your service is accessible
- evidence of usability testing, including
  - users with low level digital skills 
  - people with disability
  - people from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds
- a run through of how you’ve designed and tested for users of assistive technologies based on user research, usability testing and analytics
- ongoing testing plans for accessibility so that your users can continue to access the service.
