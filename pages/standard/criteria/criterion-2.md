## Why it’s in the Standard
Good government services are built quickly and iteratively, based on user needs. Your [digital delivery team](/standard/design-guides/the-team/) must be set up in the right way to do this. They need:

* a broad mix of skills and roles from the start
* quick decision-making processes and the ability to change and adapt as the service evolves
* to be adequately resourced and empowered to deliver the product or service.

## How you'll be assessed
This criterion applies through [all service design and delivery stages](/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/). The composition of the team will change depending on the stage and need.
You must be able to:

* describe your digital delivery team - it should have, or easily get, the following roles, as relevant to your service
  * service manager
  * product manager
  * delivery manager
  * technical architect
  * service and/or interaction designer(s) 
  * content designer
  * user researcher(s)
  * developer
  * web operations engineer
  * performance analyst
* show the team principles, vision, rituals and agile practices, for example through team charter
* demonstrate you have a product manager with the knowledge and power to make day-to-day decisions to improve the service
* show how team members stay with the service through the stages and how new members will establish empathy with the users
* show the decision making and approval processes
* know who the stakeholders are
* show that the team’s user research activities were developed and overseen by an experienced user researcher and that all team members participated in research  
* demonstrate an understanding of where gaps may emerge in the team structure and how to fill them
* demonstrate how you plan to share information, collaborate and troubleshoot issues within the team as well as with key people external to the team
* explain your plan to transfer knowledge and skills from any external people who work with the team.
