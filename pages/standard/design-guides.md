The guides are a growing collection of information to help Australian Government agencies meet the [Digital Service Standard](/standard/). The Digital Service Standard helps us to build services that are simpler, faster and easier for all users.

We are building [GOV.AU Guides](/standard/design-guides/gov-au-guides/), which will support the Digital Service Standard through common design patterns and a style guide. The GOV.AU Guides will help designers, developers, and content writers and editors to create and maintain a consistent user experience across government services.

We have also started to write a [Service Handbook](https://ausdto.github.io/service-handbook/), which provides greater detail on the stages of the [service design and delivery process](/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/).

We encourage you to provide feedback on the guides and make suggestions for additional guides: [standard@digital.gov.au](mailto:standard@digital.gov.au). Your input will help us develop the guidance you need to deliver easy to use, trusted and cost-effective digital services.
