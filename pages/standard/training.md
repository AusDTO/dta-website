## Assessing against the Digital Service Standard

This training is for government employees who will assess service teams against the Digital Service Standard. Attending this training is one step in the process of [becoming an accredited assessor](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/meeting-standard/becoming-an-assessor).

### Who is it for?

This training is for people who already have a basic knowledge of the Digital Service Standard and are looking to become an accredited assessor.

You should have experience working on digital services that meet the Standard, or at a minimum, have extensive experience in a relevant subject matter (such as user research, agile delivery, product management, technology development or similar). You are someone who thinks like a coach or mentor, rather than an auditor.

This training alone does not provide accreditation as an assessor but is a [required step in the accreditation](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/meeting-standard/becoming-an-assessor) process. Participants for this course should be selected and nominated through their agency.

Places for the course are strictly limited. Priority will be given to government employees who have been nominated or assigned to assess a service within their agency.

### What will you learn?

At the end of this training you will have an understanding of:

- the purpose of assessment against the Digital Service Standard
- completing assessments at alpha, beta and live stages of service delivery, including using tools and techniques to measure - compliance and writing assessment reports
- your role and responsibility as an assessor
- how to complete your accreditation
