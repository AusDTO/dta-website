It’s essential to measure and monitor how your service is performing so you can make sure it continues to meet user needs in a cost-effective and efficient way.

The Digital Service Standard states that [in-scope services must measure performance and report publicly](/standard/11-measure-performance/). We've set out 4 key performance indicators (KPIs) as the standard set of measures: **user satisfaction**, **digital take-up**, **completion rate** and **cost per transaction**. 

These simple metrics help you identify the strengths and weaknesses of your service, and ways to improve its performance over time. 

It’s also important to identify the specific benefits your service is expected to provide. You’ll need to establish methods to measure, monitor and validate that your service is realising these benefits.

## Report against the 4 key performance indicators

The [Digital Service Standard](/standard/) requires regular reporting of 4 key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the ongoing performance of your service.

1. **User satisfaction** - are users happy with the service you’ve provided? This is determined using web metrics and user research
2. **Digital take-up** - the percentage of your target take-up audience that you have reached
3. **Completion rate** - the percentage of completed transactions out of started transactions
4. **Cost per transaction** - the total estimated cost of your service per month (this varies for some services) divided by the number of completed transactions

## Measure benefits 

Understanding what is most valued by all of your users is critical to the success of your product. Measuring benefits and value will help you to articulate the overall success of your service.

You should: 

- track your costs from the start of the [Discovery stage](/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/discovery/)
- articulate the benefits the service is expected to provide as early as possible 
- establish baseline data for each of the service’s touchpoints
- identify the goals, signals and metrics you will need to track and monitor that the articulated benefits are being realised
- cost the time it takes for your users to complete the process before and after your redesign, if you are replacing an existing service
- develop a benefits roadmap or value stream; what might be realised and when
- confirm that the benefits you have articulated can be realised with your various prototypes
- confirm that your signals and metrics support benefits, value and cost tracking.
 
Several of the teams in the Digital Transformation Agency Digital Delivery Hub have had success using the [Digital Telepathy HEART framework](http://www.dtelepathy.com/ux-metrics/) as a starting point to considering benefits for their service.

You will want to consider which web analytics tools you will use, metrics around transitional elements - for example, retirement of legacy systems and replacement of  manual processes - and how you use open data. 

## Publish on the Performance Dashboard

Once your service moves to its public Beta stage, the performance of your service will be displayed publically on the [Performance Dashboard](/what-we-do/platforms/performance/). We will provide more information about how you can report on the dashboard soon.
