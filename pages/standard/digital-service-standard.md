The Digital Service Standard ensures digital teams build government services that are simpler, clearer and faster for all users.

[All services within the scope of the Digital Service Standard](/standard/scope-of-standard/) must work to meet the Standard. The Standard is now live and services will be assessed if design or redesign commences after 6 May 2016. You can check the [changes between the Live and Beta Standard](/standard/changes-to-standard/).
