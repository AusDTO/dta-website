{% include project-counter.html %}

  <p>Government agencies are transforming services by following the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/">service design and delivery process</a> and meeting the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/standard/">Digital Service Standard</a>.</p>

  <p>We've created delivery hubs in Sydney and Canberra where service teams can learn from and share with others on the same journey, with hands-on support from the team at the DTA.</p>
