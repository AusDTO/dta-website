The co-Lab team, led by DTA digital specialists across content design and strategy, service design, user research, accessibility and agile delivery, partners with other government teams to design and deliver better digital services.

co-Lab provides a space for teams to come together to work on products, learn about how to apply the Digital Service Standard and Service Design and Delivery Process, and accelerate innovation and change through immersive experiences.

## Experiencing co-Lab

co-Lab offers different collaborative experiences for agency teams to suit a range of needs:

- Meet, share and learn events: short-term or single day experiences with co-Lab, such as building and hosting communities of practice or stakeholder consultations
- Experimentations: opportunities for teams to conduct hands-on test or proof-of-concept of digital services or ideas over the period of a few weeks
- Residency programs: longer-term experiences where teams can immerse themselves to solve problems or explore service design thinking in a supportive environment over a few months.

Sessions are co-designed by the DTA and the partner agency teams who can apply to use the space with the intention of creating customised, fit-for-purpose experiences to achieve agreed outcomes.
