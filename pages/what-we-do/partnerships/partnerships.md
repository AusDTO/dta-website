Building and delivering excellent services online requires a transformation of the way services are designed and delivered by government.

The DTA works in close partnership with other government agencies to challenge and change the way services are traditionally delivered, and make them better.

These partnerships range in scale and duration --- from providing short-term specialist skills, support and training to long-term intensive partnerships from which major new online services are developed and delivered.

The DTAâ€™s partnership role across government also includes leading communities of practice, managing in-house product delivery teams, and building agile delivery teams inside other agencies.
