We're creating communities of practice across government to collaborate on best practice, showcase ongoing work, and create a space to solve common problems together. These communities are open to anybody in government to join.
 
We've started with communities for service design and content, and in the future we will extend this to development, product and agile delivery.

We're also documenting our best practice for building digital services in the [Design Guides]({{ site.baseurl }}/standard/design-guides/) and [Service Handbook](http://ausdto.github.io/service-handbook/).
