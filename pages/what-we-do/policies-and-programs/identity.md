At the DTA we’re working with government agencies, the private sector and the public to design and implement a digital identity solution for Australia.

We believe that it should be safe and easy for everyone to prove who they are. This means giving people a secure option to verify their identity online rather than needing to visit an office or shopfront.

To give people a consistent and reliable experience, government needs to work closely with stakeholders under common standards and using common tools.

To achieve this, we are developing a standard for establishing digital identity. We are also assisting agencies to implement a technical solution that meets the standard.

## Trusted Digital Identity Framework

The Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) provides a standard for digital identity in Australia. It aims to make sure all users have a safe and secure way to connect with government services online.

The TDIF provides the foundations for consistent, secure and reliable digital identity for everyone.

The following 10 documents make up the first component of the TDIF. They are designed to be read together and give a comprehensive overview of the standards and processes required to use or provide digital identity services.

Two future components will be added to the TDIF. These will set the standard to manage an offline option for creating a digital identity, and to authorise individuals to act on behalf of a business.

### Overview and Glossary

This document provides a high-level overview of the TDIF. It outlines the relationship between the 10 documents included in the framework, and the definition of key terms.

## Other identity policies

The DTA also manages the [Gatekeeper Public Key Infrastructure Framework](/what-we-do/policies-and-programs/identity/gatekeeper-public-key-infrastructure-framework/). Gatekeeper governs the use of digital certificates by Australian Government agencies.

The TDIF replaces the following policies, and they no longer apply:
- [National e-Authentication Framework](https://www.finance.gov.au/archive/policy-guides-procurement/authentication-and-identity-management/national-e-authentication-framework/)
- [Third Party Identity Services Assurance Framework](https://www.finance.gov.au/archive/policy-guides-procurement/third-party-identity-services-assurance-framework/)
