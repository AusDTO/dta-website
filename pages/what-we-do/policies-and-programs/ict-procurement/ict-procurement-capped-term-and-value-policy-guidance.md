## Reducing risk in ICT contracts

The [ICT Contract Capped Term and Value Policy](/what-we-do/policies-and-programs/ict-procurement/ict-capped-term-value-policy/) limits how long an initial government ICT (information and communications technology) contract can be. It also limits the financial value of the contract.

The policy helps the Australian Government minimise risk around high value contracts and gain best value for money from large ICT contracts.  
It encourages competition by breaking down large digital projects into parts. This allows businesses of all sizes to access government contracts to present innovative services.

## Who is this policy for?

Non-corporate Commonwealth entities (NCCEs) must apply this policy for all contracts signed after 23 August 2017.
We encourage Corporate Commonwealth entities (CCEs), subject to the *PGPA Act 2013*, to apply this policy voluntarily, as well as other government agencies.

## Policy details

The policy came into effect on 23 August 2017 and covers:
- the term &mdash; how long a contract lasts
- the value &mdash; how much a contract is worth

### Capped term

Under this policy, ICT contracts must meet the following conditions:
- a contract’s initial term cannot be longer than 3 years
- any extensions to the contract cannot be longer than the initial term

The policy allows a combination of an initial term and extensions to that term. For example, if the initial term of a contract is 2 years, any extension to that contract must be 2 years or less.

### Capped value

Under this policy, an ICT contract’s whole-of-life value must not be more than $100 million, exclusive of GST. A whole-of-life cost includes the cost of the initial contract plus all extensions to that contract.

## How this policy affects existing contracts

### Contracts in their initial term

If you signed a contract before 23 August 2017, and the contract is still in its initial term, it is not affected by this policy.

### Contracts being extended

If you signed a contract before 23 August 2017, you may extend the terms under the same terms and conditions, however:

You must review the contractor’s performance and/or deliverables in accordance with the contract.

The total value of the initial term and any extensions must not exceed $100 million. This whole-of-life cost includes the cost of the initial contract plus the cost of any extensions, exclusive of GST.

### Changing a contract

If you want to change the scope of an existing contract, please email us so we can check all proposed changes meet policy requirements. Changes may include adding a new service or changing the spending commitment.

## Where this policy applies automatically

If you have entered a contract under the whole-of-government ICT coordinated procurement arrangement, the contract is deemed to comply with this policy.

## Exemptions to this policy

Very few exemptions to this policy are granted and may be granted in limited circumstances, such as for national security purposes.

Exemptions can only be jointly granted by the entity’s portfolio minister and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Transformation.

If you believe you require an exemption, you must outline why you have a special need for an alternative arrangement. The [Commonwealth Procurement Rules](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.finance.gov.au/procurement/procurement-policy-and-guidance/commonwealth-procurement-rules/&sa=D&ust=1519253025002000&usg=AFQjCNEfW_XnOuoSQK52i986o_P7GZI74A) outline conditions for this.
