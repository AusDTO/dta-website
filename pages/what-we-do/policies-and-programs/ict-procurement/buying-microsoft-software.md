## What is the Microsoft VSA3?

The Microsoft Volume Sourcing Agreement 3 (VSA3) makes buying Microsoft software easier for government agencies. It also provides benefits and pricing not previously available for smaller agencies.

It does this by providing standard terms, pricing and licensing conditions for Microsoft software.

## Who is this for?

Non-corporate Commonwealth entities must use this arrangement when they’re buying Microsoft software.

Corporate Commonwealth entities can choose to use this arrangement when they’re buying Microsoft software.

[Government Business Enterprises](https://www.finance.gov.au/resource-management/governance/gbe/) are not able to use this arrangement.

## Products and services included

Microsoft products and services are grouped into 4 categories called ‘enrolments’. These are:

- Core Desktop Licensing (CDL) Enrolment
- Agency Enterprise Enrolment
- Server Cloud Enrolment
- Select-Plus

The CDL Enrolment includes the most commonly used Microsoft software:

- Microsoft Office
- Windows
- client access licenses

Products and services in the other 3 enrolments include:

- server licensing
- some desktop applications
- Microsoft Office 365 Enterprise E3, E4, E5 and Mobility Suite
- other online services
- other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Azure, CRM Online and Microsoft Intune

## How to use this arrangement

### For CDL products

Non-corporate Commonwealth entities who want to buy CDL products must do so through the DTA.

We buy and manage these products and services on behalf of the Australian Government.

### For non-CDL products

Non-corporate Commonwealth entities who want to buy non-CDL products must go through Data#3.

Microsoft does not sell its products directly. Instead it uses certified partners and resellers. We’ve signed an agreement with Data#3 to act as the sole provider (known as the [Licensed Solutions Provider](https://www.dta.gov.au/what-we-do/policies-and-programs/ict-procurement/updates/)) for government agencies using this arrangement.

Data#3 provides the following:

- quotations
- licensing advice
- licence key distribution
- invoicing
