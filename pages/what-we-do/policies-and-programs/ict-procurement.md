## What is coordinated procurement?

Coordinated procurement is when government departments and agencies work together to buy products and services they commonly use. This makes it easier for departments and agencies because it:

- simplifies the process
- reduces administrative costs
- improves terms and conditions
- secures value for money

In collaboration with departments and agencies, the DTA manages a range of ICT coordinated procurement arrangements and contracts.

## Buying ICT products for government

The DTA helps government departments and agencies buy the ICT products and services they need.

This is often done through panels and volume sourcing arrangements, and depends on the type of product being purchased.

If you are from a government department or agency, you can find out more about [buying ICT products for government](/what-we-do/policies-and-programs/ict-procurement/buying).

## Selling ICT products to government

Government looks to purchase ICT products and services that demonstrate [value for money](https://www.finance.gov.au/procurement/procurement-policy-and-guidance/commonwealth-procurement-rules/) for the Australian taxpayer.

The government must also follow certain rules when buying goods and services as described in the [*Commonwealth Procurement Rules*](https://www.finance.gov.au/procurement/procurement-policy-and-guidance/commonwealth-procurement-rules/).

If you want to sell ICT products or services to government, learn more about [finding opportunities, submitting applications and winning business](/what-we-do/policies-and-programs/ict-procurement/selling).

## Example ICT Contracts

The DTA has examples of model contracts for buying ICT products or services. These are called the [SourceIT model contracts](http://www.finance.gov.au/policy-guides-procurement/sourceit-model-contracts/).

SourceIT contracts can help you to buy software or related services that are not covered by a panel or volume sourcing arrangement. They are template contracts that help you to minimise the risk of conflict and disagreements between parties.

The DTA can help with general information on the SourceIT contracts but specific procurement and legal information should be sought from your own department.

## Policies

The DTA manages ICT coordinated procurement arrangements. These arrangements are formed in line with the coordinated procurement contracting framework overseen by the Department of Finance.

## Reviewing how we buy products and services

We are currently [reviewing how government buys ICT products and services](/what-we-do/policies-and-programs/ict-procurement/ict-procurement-review/), and exploring how we can make ICT procurement a simpler and faster process for everyone involved.

## Procurement Taskforce

Information about the [Procurement Taskforce](/what-we-do/policies-and-programs/ict-procurement/ict-procurement-review/) is available from the DTA website.

The responsibility for whole of government ICT procurement moved from the Department of Finance to the Digital Transformation Agency in May 2017. This move is part of the agency’s expanded responsibility to deliver on the government’s Digital Transformation Agenda.
