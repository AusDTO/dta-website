The Digital Investment Management Office has been set up within the DTA to 
provide oversight of all significant government ICT and digital investment projects across government.

Each year government spends around $6.2 billion on ICT investments. By developing new and more strategic approaches to investment analysis, governance, risk management and program and benefits management, we will be able to provide greater transparency and optimisation of the government’s investment portfolio.

An initial priority for the office will be to undertake a review of the government’s annual ICT spend and provide a comprehensive picture of the costs, benefits, risks and status of all projects and programs worth more than $10 million.

The DTA is due to report to government in mid-2017 on the costs, risks and status of this work.

The office will also focus on establishing ongoing strategic partnerships across government to provide independent assurance and improved benefits delivery for both agencies and people that use government services online.
