<h2 id="What-are-the-Women-in-IT-programs">What are the Women in IT programs?</h2>
<p>The Women in IT programs support the career progression of women currently working in Information Technology (IT) in the Australian Public Service (APS). The goal is to attract and retain talented women with IT skills within the APS, and to increase the gender diversity of senior IT employees. </p>

<p>The program is made up of a number of different streams for women (and those who identify as female) at different stages in their careers.</p>

<h3>Executive mentoring program</h3>
<p>The Women in IT executive mentoring program is for talented EL2 women who are looking to progress their career within IT.</p>

<p>In this program, mentees are matched with a mentor (typically a CIO) from another department or agency for 12 months. The program involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>face-to-face mentoring</li>
<li>inter-departmental learning</li>
<li>facilitated group sessions</li>
<li>networking</li>
</ul>
<p>Agencies and departments are asked to nominate a mentor (typically a CIO) and an EL2 mentee.</p>
<p>The program begins in April/May each year and runs for 12 months. More information will be provided on this program early 2018.</p>

<h3>EL1 coaching program</h3>
<p>The Women in IT coaching program is for talented EL1 women who are looking to gain leadership skills within their field.</p>
<p>This 12 month program provides high quality executive coaching in small groups to help women develop and nurture their leadership skills. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 facilitated training sessions (3 hours each)</li>
<li>small group coaching</li>
<li>CIO, SES and EL2 guest speakers</li>
<li>networking opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>The course covers the following leadership skills and topics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who am I as a leader?</li>
<li>Where am I going?</li>
<li>How will I get there?</li>
</ol>
<p>You can <a href="/files/DTA_women-in-IT-coaching-course-outline.pdf" download>download the course outline</a> for more information.</p>
<p>CIOs or agencies will be asked to nominate talented EL1 women from their department or agency to participate in this program.</p>
<p>Nominations for this program are now closed.</p>
<p>Cost: $5,000.00‑$6,600.00 (GST inclusive) per participant excluding travel. The costs will depend on the final number of participants, and their location.</p>
<p>The program will be delivered in Canberra as well as in other cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or Brisbane) depending on interest. Sessions outside of Canberra will only be run if there are 8 or more participants in that location. Please note that participants outside of Canberra may be required to attend a small number of events in Canberra. Funding for this travel would need to be provided by the agency.</p>
<h3>APS 5&ndash;6 career development</h3>
<p>We are currently exploring options for a new program for APS 5 and 6 women. This program will support women working in technical IT roles to transition into management.</p>
