A review into how government buys ICT products and services began in October 2016. It moved over from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to the DTA in February 2017.

The review taskforce is assessing ICT procurement across government. The final report will make recommendations to:

- improve the way government buys ICT good and services
- make it easier for startups and small and medium businesses to compete for government ICT contracts

[Download the consultation paper (PDF, 14 pages, 836kb)](/files/ICT-Procurement-Taskforce-Consultation-Paper-WCAG2.pdf) for more information about the review.

The final report will be delivered to government mid 2017.
