lede: Identity providers must be accredited against the Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) before joining the identity federation. Digital services don’t need to be formally accredited, however they must follow the same rules.

## Identity providers

There is one Commonwealth Government run identity provider — myGovID. This is managed by the Australian Taxation Office.
Other businesses and organisations can become identity providers in the future so people can choose which one they use to access government services online.

If your organisation is interested in becoming an identity provider, you can email [identity@dta.gov.au](mailto:identity@dta.gov.au)

## Digital Services

Digital services are run by a government agency or other organisation. They rely on the identity exchange to confirm the identity of someone who is accessing one of their online services.

Any public-facing, online service that requires the user to prove who they are could be made simpler and faster through the use of the exchange.

Until mid-2019 we are rolling out a series of pilot programs that will allow us to continue to test and evaluate myGovID and the broader digital identity system. Following the completion of this testing more services will be onboarded.

If your organisation is interested in connecting your service to the exchange, you can email [identity@dta.gov.au](identity@dta.gov.au)
