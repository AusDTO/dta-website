lede: myGovID — your key to easier access to government services
---

<p dir="ltr">In the future, Australians will be given the opportunity to use a digital identity, selected from a range of different providers, to access government services online.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Commonwealth Government will operate one digital identity provider called myGovID. </p>

<p dir="ltr">To make sure the best systems are developed, we are beginning this digital journey with a series of pilot programs, rolling out from late 2018.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Australian Taxation Office is running the first pilot. For the first time, Australians applying for a tax file number (TFN) will have the opportunity to do so with a digital identity – in this case, myGovID. The new process means that instead of completing a form, printing it and then taking it with your identity documents to a post office, the entire transaction can be done online using myGovID as proof of your identity. This will reduce the waiting time for a TFN from up to 30 days to only a few minutes.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As all the pilot programs roll out, we’ll continue to use agile development methods to adapt and align our systems with user needs. Our goal is to make accessing government services online simple, clear and fast.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A total of eight pilot programs will be completed by mid-2019. Over time, you’ll be able to access more government services over the internet using myGovID. Creating a digital identity to access government services online is entirely your choice. If you prefer, you can still call or visit a government service centre in person.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">How your myGovID is created</h2>

<p dir="ltr">The initial myGovID system will be available as an iPhone application. Further down the track, you will be able to create a myGovID from any device.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Setting up your myGovID will take less than 10 minutes and involves just a few steps. You will be asked to provide a mobile contact number and email address. You will then be asked for details from some of your existing identity documents, for example, the number on your driver’s license, passport or Medicare card.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Once you have provided these details, a government organisation that holds these records will verify the information you enter about yourself. For example, the number on your birth certificate would be confirmed by the registry of births for the state you were born in. This is done electronically in only a few seconds.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In order to access some services that need a high level of identity proofing, you may need to provide a photo of yourself. It’s possible to create a myGovID without a photo, but it will only be able to be used to access government services which do not need photo ID.</p>

<p dir="ltr">You will only need to complete these steps once to create your myGovID account. After it is set up, all you will need to access a government online service is your registered email address and a code sent via the myGovID app.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">What happens to your data</h2>

<p dir="ltr">You will have control of your personal information at all times and nothing will be shared without your permission.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The myGovID system keeps your name, date of birth, email and phone number but discards the details of your personal identity documents and your photograph once your identity is confirmed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">When accessing government services, the digital service won’t see your personal information and myGovID won’t know what service you’re accessing.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">What the future looks like</h2>

<p dir="ltr">In the future, Australians will have the opportunity to access simple, clear and fast public services online with their digital identity.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Here is a glimpse of what this could look like for you.</p>
