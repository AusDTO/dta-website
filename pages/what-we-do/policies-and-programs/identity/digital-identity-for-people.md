---

In the future, Australians will be given the opportunity to use a digital identity, selected from a range of different providers, to access government services online.

The Commonwealth Government will run one digital identity provider called myGovID.

To make sure the best system is developed, we’re rolling out a series of pilot programs from late 2018 to be completed by mid-2019. Over time, you’ll be able to access more government services using myGovID.

The first pilot using myGovID is an end-to-end digital tax file number (TFN) application process. The new process means that instead of completing a form, printing it and then taking it with your identity documents to a post office, the entire transaction can be done online using myGovID as proof of your identity. This will reduce the waiting time for a TFN from up to a month to only a few minutes.

As the pilot programs roll out, we’ll continue to use agile development methods to adapt and align the system with user needs.

Creating a digital identity to access government services online is entirely your choice. If you prefer, you can still call or visit a government service centre in person.

##Creating your myGovID

The initial myGovID system will be available as an iPhone application. Further down the track, you will be able to create a myGovID from any device.

Setting up your myGovID will take less than 10 minutes and involves just a few steps.
You will be asked to provide a mobile number and email address. You will then be asked for details from some of your existing identity documents, for example, the number on your Australian driver’s licence, passport or Medicare card.

Once you have provided these details, a government organisation that holds these records will verify the information you enter about yourself. For example, the number on your driver’s licence would be confirmed by the state it was issued in. This is done electronically in only a few seconds.

In order to access some services that need a high level of identity proofing, you may need to provide a photo of yourself.

It’s possible to create a myGovID without a photo, but it will only be able to be used to access government services which do not need photo ID.

You will only need to complete these steps once to create your myGovID account. After it is set up, all you will need to
access a government online service is your registered email address.

##What happens to your data

You will have control of your personal information at all times and nothing will be shared without your permission.

When accessing government services, the digital service won’t see your personal information and myGovID won’t know what service you’re accessing.
