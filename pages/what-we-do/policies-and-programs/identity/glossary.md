<h2 id="attributes">Attributes</h2>

<p dir="ltr">Attributes are pieces of information that help verify information about a person. For example, name, address and date of birth.</p>


<a href="#content" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="attribute-provider">Attribute provider</h2>

<p dir="ltr">An attribute provider can verify something about you which a service may need to know. For example, the Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM) managed by the Australian Taxation Office can verify relationships between an individual and a business. If you wanted to let your accountant manage your taxes, this relationship would be verified by RAM.</p>


<a href="#content" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="digital-identity">Digital identity</h2>

<p dir="ltr">Created once a person’s identity is verified online, without the need to visit a government office. A digital identity can be used over and over again to securely access a range of government services.</p>


<a href="#content" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="digital-service">Digital service</h2>

<p dir="ltr">In the digital identity ecosystem, a digital service is a public-facing, online system that requires those using it to prove who they are. They are also known as a relying parties.</p>


<a href="#content" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="document-verification-service">Document Verification Service</h2>

<p dir="ltr">The Document Verification Service (DVS) is a system that confirms an identity document by comparing it to a record held by the government. For example, birth certificates are verified by the relevant state agency for births, deaths and marriages. myGovID will rely on this service when issuing someone’s digital identity. The DVS is run by the Department of Home Affairs.</p>


<a href="#content" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="face-verification-service">Face Verification Service</h2>

<p dir="ltr">The Face Verification Service (FVS) is a system that confirms an image of a person by matching it against an existing government record. For example, an image of your face taken on your phone can be compared to an image held by the Australian Passport office. myGovID will rely on this service when issuing someone’s digital identity. The FVS is run by the Department of Home Affairs.</p>


<a href="#content" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a>

<h2 id="govpass">GovPass</h2>

<p>GovPass is the name for the digital identity program of work being delivered. This includes everything from the policy and processes to the technology and systems.&nbsp;</p>


<a href="#content" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="identity-document">Identity document</h2>

<p dir="ltr">An identity document is a physical record that proves who you are. Examples include a birth certificate, passport or driver’s license.</p>


<a href="#content" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="identity-exchange">Identity exchange</h2>

<p dir="ltr">The identity exchange sits between the digital service and the identity provider. It protects the user’s privacy by making sure:</p>
<ul><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">the digital service can’t see the user’s personal information</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">the identity provider can’t see which service the user is accessing</p>
</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr">This is called a ‘double blind’ exchange. The Commonwealth’s exchange will be managed by the Department of Human Services</p>


<a href="#content" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="identity-federation">Identity federation</h2>

<p dir="ltr">The identity federation is a trusted circle of organisations, made up of:</p>
<ul><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">identity providers — currently only myGovID provided by the Australian Taxation Office</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">attribute providers</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">digital services</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">the identity exchange manager — Department of Human Services</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a href="#content" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="identity-proofing">Identity proofing</h2>

<p dir="ltr">Identity proofing describes the process of collecting and verifying information about a person to confirm their identity. Different online services need different levels of identity proofing. There are 4 levels of identity proofing that apply to different services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, if you want to pay rates, you can stay anonymous. If you want to get a unique student identifier, you may need an identity document. If you want to apply for a Tax File Number, you may need an identity document and a photo of yourself. If you want to apply for a passport, you may need an identity document, a photo of yourself and an in-person check.</p>


<a href="#content" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="identity-provider">Identity provider</h2>

<p dir="ltr">People can use an identity provider to prove their identity online. There is one Commonwealth Government run identity provider — myGovID. This is managed by the Australian Taxation Office. We expect other businesses and government agencies to become identity providers in the future to allow people to choose how they prove who they are online.</p>


<a href="#content" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="mygovid">myGovID</h2>

<p dir="ltr">myGovID is the Commonwealth Government-run identity provider. Setting up a myGovID account will be like a 100 point identity check, but done online, rather than in person in a government service centre. Once it is set up, a myGovID can be used over and over again as a form of identity to access different government service. This system is managed by the Australian Taxation Office.</p>


<a href="#content" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="trusted-digital-identity-framework">Trusted Digital Identity Framework</h2>

<p dir="ltr">The Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) sets out the rules and standards everyone in the identity federation needs to follow. It also contains guidance for following these rules.</p>
