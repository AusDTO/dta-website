<p dir="ltr">Having to show your identity documents in person is the biggest barrier to government services being available end-to-end online.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The digital identity program will give Australian citizens and permanent residents a single and secure way to create a digital identity which can be used to access online government services.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The program has a number of key components:</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>a set of rules and standards which make sure the system is secure and accessible, called the <a href="/what-we-do/policies-and-programs/identity/join-the-identity-federation/accreditation-and-onboarding/trusted-digital-identity-framework">Trusted Digital Identity Framework</a></li>
	<li>digital identity providers, including the Commonwealth identity provider, myGovID, run by the Australian Taxation Office</li>
	<li>the identity exchange, which acts as a gateway between the government service and the digital identity providers, run by the Department of Human Services</li>
	<li>the digital services that rely on the digital identity program to confirm that someone is authorised to access their service</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">These parts work together to deliver a secure digital identity program which protects the privacy of those who use it.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The first stage of the program will allow you to access services for individuals. In the future, your digital identity will enable you to access services on behalf of a business or even on behalf of someone who authorises you.</p>
