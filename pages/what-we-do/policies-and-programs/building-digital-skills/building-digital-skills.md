We’re helping agencies across government raise the level of digital skills in the Australian Public Service.

Skilled staff are crucial to delivering effective digital services. But technology is always advancing — and so are the capabilities needed to transform services.

To keep up with changing user expectations, government agencies need to:

- attract, keep and develop staff with specialist digital skills
- improve the digital literacy of senior leaders
- make sure existing staff have access to the tools and resources they need to deliver better digital services

We help government agencies build digital skills in the following ways.

{% include hx.html lvl=2 text="Online help and guidance" %}

We provide guides and tools to help government teams set up, run and maintain a digital service.

{% include hx.html lvl=2 text="Digital Service Standard training" %}

Digital Service Standard training

We offer free training to help government teams understand and meet the Digital Service Standard.

{% include hx.html lvl=2 text="Entry-level digital programs" %}

We provide entry-level programs across the Australian Public Service for people starting their digital or technical careers.

The programs provide apprentice, cadet and graduate roles in government agencies.

{% include hx.html lvl=2 text="Coaching and mentoring for women" %}

We organise the Women in IT coaching and mentoring programs. These help women develop leadership skills and increase their numbers in digital roles in government.

{% include hx.html lvl=2 text="Building Digital Capability program" %}

We’re introducing a new Building Digital Capability program with the Australian Public Service Commission.

The program will:
- attract digital talent to the Australian Public Service
- create clear career pathways
- help managers create digital teams
- inspire leaders to take a visionary approach to creating digital services

We’ll start rolling out the program’s training, professional development and more from mid-2018.

{% include hx.html lvl=2 text="Agency partnerships" %}

We form partnerships with other government agencies. We work with them to build or redevelop digital services.

As part of this work we mentor and coach people working in government. We provide guidance and advice on service design, product management, content design, strategy, interaction design and user research.

{% include hx.html lvl=2 text="Workshops, meet-ups and events" %}

We run regular workshops and meet-ups at our Canberra and Sydney offices for people working in government. We do this to help agencies develop internal skills to improve government services.

We also host guest speakers and hold pop-up events in areas such as user research, service design, interaction design, content design and so on.

{% include hx.html lvl=2 text="Digital communities of practice" %}

We organise communities of practice that bring together people working in government to share ideas, show their work, solve problems and explore best practice.

We have communities of practice for service design, user research, project management and content design.
