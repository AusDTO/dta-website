In December 2016 responsibility for the _Style manual_ was transferred to the DTA.

We have recently started work on the 7th edition of the _Style manual_.

We are working with agencies across government to make sure that the 7th edition meets the needs of its users. This work is also supported by a governance board.

A [discovery](/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/) (research) phase is complete and alpha (prototyping) will start in 2018.

For more information please contact [stylemanual@digital.gov.au](mailto:stylemanual@digital.gov.au)
