## Digital Service Standard

<p class="lede">
   We've established the criteria that Australian Government digital services need to meet to be simpler, clearer and faster.
</p>

<p>
The 13 criteria of the Standard check that services have a strong understanding of user needs, adopted an agile approach to technology and delivery, and have the capability to support and iterate the service on an ongoing basis.
</p>

<p>
The Standard applies to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/standard/scope-of-standard/">all new and redesigned government services, and all high volume transactional services</a>.
There are <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/standard/meeting-standard/">assessments</a> at the Alpha, Beta and Live stages.
