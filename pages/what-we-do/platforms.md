## Cloud

<div class="lede">
    We're creating a new platform to make delivering and operating digital services easier.
</div>

cloud.gov.au is a faster, safer, standard way to change web apps without impacting users. It makes it easier for government to release, monitor and grow user-facing digital services, freeing up teams to focus on writing code that meets user needs.

As of October 2016, cloud.gov.au has 37 apps in production, and 225 apps in development across the [exemplar](/what-we-do/exemplars/) and [platforms](/what-we-do/platforms/) programmes of work.. 

DTA services running on cloud.gov.au include the [Digital Marketplace](/what-we-do/marketplace/), the [Performance Dashboard](/what-we-do/platforms/performance/), and the australia.gov.au [Media Release Service](https://media.australia.gov.au).

We [publish real time performance statistics](http://status.cloud.gov.au) of both the cloud.gov.au platform itself, and the apps running on cloud.gov.au.

If you are interested in building new digital services on cloud.gov.au, please [get in contact with us](mailto:support@cloud.gov.au).

## Digital identity

<div class="lede">
    We're making it easier for people to prove who they are when using government services online.
</div>

Users should only need to establish their identity once when using different government services online. We're building an alpha (protoype) of a service to verify the identity of individuals to a level that means they can access government services.

We've completed an extensive discovery process to understand the full digital trust management landscape in Australia. The research aimed to:

- understand usersâ€™ experiences of establishing an online identity to access government services
- understand pain points experienced by users during identity verification and authentication processes
- identify barriers to completing the online verification and authentication process.

In parallel to our user research work, we have been engaging with a cross section of Australian business, including the financial sector, and also with state and territory governments. 

We have also been actively researching the different trust models that operate internationally, including those in the UK, US, Canada and New Zealand.  Our intention is to learn from these different experiences but to develop a solution that is fit for purpose in an Australian context.

We are also developing a comprehensive framework (Trusted Digital Identity Framework or TDIF) to make it easier for the DTA and other government agencies to work together.

## GOV.AU

<div class="lede">
    We're making it simpler, clearer and faster for people to access government services and information.
</div>

<a href="https://www.gov.au/alpha" class="big-button">See the prototype</a>
<a href="/blog/gov-au/">Read the blog</a>

GOV.AU will draw on service design techniques to focus on the needs of users. It will join up services provided by different agencies and tiers of government, so people can get things done with government in a single journey.

We'll also be putting government information in one place.

The GOV.AU team also manages the [australia.gov.au](http://www.australia.gov.au/) website.

## Performance dashboard

<div class="lede">
    We're publishing information about the performance of government services on a new dashboard.
</div>

The [performance dashboard](https://www.dashboard.gov.au/) will publicly measure the performance of Australian Government services against the metrics defined by criterion 11 of the [Digital Service Standard](/standard).

By making this data more accessible, the dashboard will drive the continuous improvement of government services for users and increase government transparency.
