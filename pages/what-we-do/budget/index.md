---

This year’s Budget provides $254.7m over four years from 2015-16 to support the initial implementation of the Agenda. This includes $95.4m to fund the operation of the Digital Transformation Office as well as funding for the implementation of the projects that form stage one of the Agenda. More information can be found in the Minister for Communications, the Hon Malcolm Turnbull’s [media release](http://www.minister.communications.gov.au/malcolm_turnbull/news/investing_in_digital_transformation).

Our CEO highlights the transformation in his [2015-16 Budget blog](/blog/the-digital-transformation-agenda-in-the-2015-16-federal-budget/). Further information on stage-one projects is below.

## New services for individuals
The Government is committed to radically transforming service delivery to Australians. This will be achieved through a number of [new services for individuals](/budget/new-services-for-individuals/), which will make it easier and faster for people to access services across multiple agencies.

## New services for business
The Government is also committed to making it quicker and more affordable for business to transact with government online and will deliver [new services for business](/budget/new-services-for-business/).

The Agenda will also support the implementation of Streamlining Business Registration announced in the [Growing Jobs and Small Business package](http://www.budget.gov.au/2015-16/content/glossy/sml_bus/html/sml_bus-04.htm). This will simplify the process of registering a business.

## The Digital Service Standard
The [Digital Service Standard](/standard/) will establish a consistent digital-by-design approach to government service delivery. It will apply to all government agencies to make services simpler and easier to use.

## Trusted Digital Identity Framework
The [Trusted Digital Identity Framework](/budget/trusted-digital-identity-framework/) will provide individuals and businesses with easier ways to access government services through the use of government or private digital identities.

## Better grants administration
The [better grants administration](/budget/better-grants-administration/) initiative will streamline and simplify grants administration processes across 12 agencies, making the management of grants simpler and more efficient for government, applicants, and grant recipients.
