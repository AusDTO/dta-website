The transformation of online government services involves both large and small scale change.

The DTA works closely with other government agencies to transform individual services while also offering advice and expertise to drive whole-of-government transformation.

Six exemplar projects have been hosted in our Sydney and Canberra design hubs. These products are examples of what is possible when transforming services and how incremental change can greatly improve access to government services.

We provided expertise in user research, service design and technical development and worked alongside staff from the service delivery agency.

The digital products **link to current page** continue to be tested and it is expected a number will soon be rolled out to the public.
