## A content strategy --- by government, for government

The DTA has come together with over 30 government agencies to co-create guidance that helps government teams to implement their own content strategies, to help get their digital estates in order. 

This work builds on work already being done across government to improve information and services for users and taps into valuable public service expertise. It is part of the DTA’s vision to make it easier for users to get things done with government --- without needing to know how government is structured.

## Guidance that addresses government needs

Released iteratively in [an Agile way](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/design-guides/agile/), the content strategy guidance:

- includes best practice advice for the creation, delivery and  of useful and usable content

- addresses the daily challenges that stop many agencies from publishing clear, user-centered content

- encourages agencies to reduce and regularly maintain the size of their digital estates, making it easier for users to find what they need, when they need it

- covers a range of topics including content auditing, removing content, creating accessible content, user-centred content, Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), content governance (workflows, sign-offs and publishing check-points) and more.

We are regularly releasing topics. [See what’s available](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-strategy/)
