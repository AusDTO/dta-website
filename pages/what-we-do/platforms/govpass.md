Currently in its beta stage of development, Govpass will offer users quick and simple options to prove who they are.

Users will be able to prove themselves by having an accredited organisation vouch for them, such as a government agency, or in the future, even their own bank. 

## Privacy and personal information 

Privacy and protection of personal information is at the heart of this project.

The DTA is building and testing new technology, called **the exchange**, that will act as a safe and secure go between for the department and the organisation or **verifier** that can vouch for a user. 

The exchange will seek an electronic tick of approval from an accredited verifier, giving the user access to a range of government online services.

Because privacy is important, we are continuing to involve privacy and civil liberties advocacy groups in this project.

We have also commissioned a series of independent privacy impact assessments to identify any potential issues that should be considered in the design and delivery of this project. 

## When will the new changes be available?

This is a complex project and requires a strong legal and organisational framework, so we’re doing a lot of work with other government departments and private sector organisations to make sure we get everything right. 

We’ll continue to test the new technology and work with our stakeholders over the coming year to get an agreed and consistent framework in place. 

By mid-2017, we expect to be testing the product with selected users, and by 2018, we expect to have the products available for all users to test on a limited number of government services.

The short term improvements will offer users a simpler and easier process of proving who they are to access a range of basic online government services.

Longer term improvements will allow users to do more complex online transactions, meaning they may not need to visit a shop front at all, unless they choose to.
