cloud.gov.au will make it easier to release, monitor and grow user-facing digital services. This will free up teams to focus on writing code to meet user needs.

We're testing the platform with a small number of [services in our delivery hubs](/what-we-do/exemplars/). We'll be opening this up to more services later in 2016.
