cloud.gov.au is a faster, safer, standard way to change web apps without impacting users. It makes it easier for government to release, monitor and grow user-facing digital services, freeing up teams to focus on writing code that meets user needs.

As of October 2016, cloud.gov.au has 37 apps in production, and 225 apps in development across the [exemplar](/what-we-do/exemplars/) and [platforms](/what-we-do/platforms/) programs of work.

DTA services running on cloud.gov.au include the [Digital Marketplace](/what-we-do/marketplace/), the [Performance Dashboard](/what-we-do/platforms/performance/), and the australia.gov.au [Media Release Service](https://media.australia.gov.au).

We [publish real time performance statistics](http://status.cloud.gov.au) of both the cloud.gov.au platform itself, and the apps running on cloud.gov.au.

If you are interested in building new digital services on cloud.gov.au, please [get in contact with us](mailto:support@cloud.gov.au).
