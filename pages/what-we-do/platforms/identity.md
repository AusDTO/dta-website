Users should only need to establish their identity once when using different government services online. We're building an alpha (protoype) of a service to verify the identity of individuals to a level that means they can access government services.

We've completed an extensive discovery process to understand the full digital trust management landscape in Australia. The research aimed to:

- understand usersâ€™ experiences of establishing an online identity to access government services
- understand pain points experienced by users during identity verification and authentication processes
- identify barriers to completing the online verification and authentication process.

In parallel to our user research work, we have been engaging with a cross section of Australian business, including the financial sector, and also with state and territory governments. 

We have also been actively researching the different trust models that operate internationally, including those in the UK, US, Canada and New Zealand.  Our intention is to learn from these different experiences but to develop a solution that is fit for purpose in an Australian context.

We are also developing a comprehensive framework (Trusted Digital Identity Framework or TDIF) to make it easier for the DTA and other government agencies to work together.
