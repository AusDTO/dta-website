The GOV.AU project has a simple vision: to make it easier for users to get things done with government, without needing to know how government works.

We developed Alpha and Beta in an agile way – starting small, iterating often and building a collaborative approach with our government stakeholders.

Adapting to change is a normal part of transformation projects. So is being flexible to the feedback we receive from our users as a project develops.

GOV.AU is focused on delivering a whole-of-government program that identifies best practice and guides the creation, delivery and governance of useful and usable content. We are working on this in partnership with representatives from 30 government agencies. 

We’ll continue to keep you updated on the progress of the GOV.AU project through our blog.
