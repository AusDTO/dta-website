GOV.AU will draw on service design techniques to focus on the needs of users. It will join up services provided by different agencies and tiers of government, so people can get things done with government in a single journey.

We'll also be putting government information in one place.

The GOV.AU team also manages the [australia.gov.au](http://www.australia.gov.au/) website.
