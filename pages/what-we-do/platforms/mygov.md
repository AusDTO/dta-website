We are working with the Department of Human Services (DHS) to develop and improve the [myGov](https://my.gov.au/LoginServices/main/login?execution=e2s1) service.

On 1 July 2016, the DTA became the business owner of myGov. We are responsible for:
- governance
- strategy
- policy
- user experience
- changes to the current service regarding policy objectives or user needs
- onboarding of new government services

DHS continues to be responsible for implementing designs, technical development, and the operation and performance of the myGov Service.

Recently, we worked with DHS to deliver a [new look and feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV6hPRrHnOA) for the myGov platform.

## Service onboarding

Part of our work includes helping government services connect with the myGov platform. You can use myGov to improve your online service delivery with the single login or other features like a secure inbox for communications. 

If your service could benefit from being connected to myGov, or you would like more information, email us at [myGov.policy@dta.gov.au](mailto:myGov.policy@dta.gov.au)
