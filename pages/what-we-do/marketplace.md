The Australian government spends more than $6 billion on ICT and digital services each year. The marketplace simplifies the procurement process and removes barriers, particularly for smaller businesses who may have previously had difficulty connecting with government.

Currently in beta phase, the [Digital Marketplace](https://marketplace.service.gov.au/) opened in August 2016 with a limited number of product categories for sellers and buyers. In this first phase the number of sellers was also capped. 

In February 2017, the marketplace opened to an unlimited number of sellers in an increased number of categories:
- Strategy and policy
- User research and design
- Agile delivery and governance
- Software engineering and development
- Change, training and transformation
- Marketing, communications and engagement 
- Cyber security 
- Data science 
- Emerging technologies
- Support and operations 
- Content and publishing
- Recruitment

The Marketplace also allows sellers to identify themselves as a number of business types including startups, small-to-medium enterprise, and Indigenous-owned or disability enterprises. This allows government to support the growth of these businesses.

The [Digital Marketplace](https://marketplace.service.gov.au/) is being delivered by the DTA as part of the [National Innovation and Science Agenda](http://www.innovation.gov.au/page/digital-marketplace).
