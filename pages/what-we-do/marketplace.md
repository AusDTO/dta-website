We're transforming how government buys digital services, and making it easier for businesses to work with us - take a look at our [Digital Marketplace beta](https://www.gov.au/marketplace).

One of our key missions is removing barriers to make it easier for businesses of all sizes to access government ICT contracts and supporting government to become better digital and technology buyers, in particular through the digital marketplace.

The Digital Marketplace Beta is making it easier for SMEs and start-ups to work with government. The Beta was released on 29 August 2016, with delivery a full 5 months ahead of schedule.

Our vision is to create an end-to-end digital environment that accommodates the level of simplicity, creativity and structure appropriate to each procurement interaction.

This is being delivered as part of the National Innovation and Science Agenda.
