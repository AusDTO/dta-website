1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:03,986

2
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,131
- [Narrator] Design has the potential

3
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:15,239
to transform our world.

4
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:17,106
Its purpose is to help us do things.

5
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:20,485
So when design is good,
it becomes invisible.

6
00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:22,197
It's a bit like air conditioning:

7
00:00:22,197 --> 00:00:24,853
you don't even notice it's
there until it stops working.

8
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:26,334
- I don't think users even notice

9
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:27,958
good content and they shouldn't.

10
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,981
They should never even notice it

11
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:31,172
and I think that's when we know

12
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:32,741
we've done our job really well,

13
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,381
is when it just works
and there's no problems.

14
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:39,394
I think we notice bad
content straight away.

15
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:41,960
- [Narrator] Good design
also keeps people safe.

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,565
It works hard to protect privacy

17
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:45,925
and security, and that builds trust.

18
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:48,539
The best way to achieve
good design is to put people

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,625
at the centre of the process,
right from the start.

20
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,320
This is called user-centered design,

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,114
and it's the heart of the
Digital Service Standard.

22
00:00:57,114 --> 00:01:00,875
So how does our user-centered
service design work?

23
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,640
First of all, let's just be clear.

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,236
Service doesn't mean website.

25
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:07,624
A service helps people do something.

26
00:01:07,624 --> 00:01:11,088
The website is simply the layer
that people interact with.

27
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:13,084
A successful user-centered design

28
00:01:13,084 --> 00:01:15,078
process challenges assumptions.

29
00:01:15,078 --> 00:01:16,542
It spends time getting to know

30
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,582
the users to define the problem,

31
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:20,543
before even thinking about the solution.

32
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:22,782
Because when we really get
to know the motivations

33
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:26,291
of our users in their context,
we are better able to design

34
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,649
a service that will meet their needs.

35
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:30,407
It's important to think about the whole

36
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:33,107
user journey, and then
identify which point

37
00:01:33,107 --> 00:01:35,600
in that journey you're designing for.

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,698
For example, finding
out if you're eligible

39
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,530
to become a childminder is different

40
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,654
to gathering documents so you can apply.

41
00:01:42,654 --> 00:01:46,075
We have to look at the whole
picture, the whole ecosystem,

42
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:49,171
and how all the parts come
together for our users.

43
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:52,700
We design with the whole
end-to-end service in mind.

44
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,646
The Standard guides us in a new approach

45
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:58,571
that allows us to deliver
solutions to users quickly.

46
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:00,111
So when designing, we don't

47
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:02,241
tackle the whole thing in one go.

48
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:05,415
We begin with a thin slice,
starting small to produce

49
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:08,375
something that people can
use as fast as possible.

50
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,995
This involves making prototypes

51
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:12,579
based on our research
into the user's needs.

52
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:16,179
We should prototype lots of
different ideas and approaches.

53
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:18,206
Our prototypes start as low-fidelity

54
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:21,210
paper drawings, wireframes or similar.

55
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,718
This way we can explore as
many options as we need to,

56
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:26,180
with the knowledge that it's much

57
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,654
less expensive to make mistakes on paper.

58
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:30,628
Then we test them with real people,

59
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:34,308
measuring and gathering data
to inform the next iteration.

60
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:36,457
Once our tests with real users tell us

61
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:39,765
we've got some ideas that might
succeed, we start to develop

62
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:43,908
those designs in code, that
is HTML working copies.

63
00:02:43,908 --> 00:02:46,902
Exploring a range of ideas
and alternatives with users

64
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:49,348
is faster and much less expensive.

65
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:51,636
It's a vital part of the design process.

66
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:54,674
Iterating like this makes
big failures unlikely

67
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,347
and turns small failures into lessons.

68
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:59,543
If an idea or a prototype isn't working

69
00:02:59,543 --> 00:03:01,174
when you put it in front of your users,

70
00:03:01,174 --> 00:03:03,734
don't be afraid to scrap
it and start again.

71
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:06,659
Understanding which ideas
and prototypes don't work

72
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:09,742
is an important way to learn quickly.

73
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:15,641
- I mean, fail, F-A-I-L, means
First Attempt In Learning.

74
00:03:17,623 --> 00:03:19,366
That's what the acronym means.

75
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,602
So, failure is useful if we learn

76
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:24,688
something from it and
it's good to fail early.

77
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:28,771
If we spend a billion
dollars on a big IT system,

78
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:33,725
we have a huge risk because we have picked

79
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:36,371
one option out of a million options,

80
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:41,089
and we have followed that to
the end, the bitter end often.

81
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:43,510
And then when we face the music,

82
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,959
it is often the right solution

83
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,648
to the wrong question at best.

84
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:48,978
- [Narrator] So have courage.

85
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,618
Feel empowered to try, fail and try again.

86
00:03:52,618 --> 00:03:55,524
Good design takes multiple
viewpoints into account.

87
00:03:55,524 --> 00:03:57,343
This is why the Standard specifies

88
00:03:57,343 --> 00:03:59,887
that you work in multidisciplinary teams,

89
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:02,649
to bring together different
perspectives, mindsets,

90
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:04,795
biases and complementary skills

91
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:07,111
from the very start of the service design.

92
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:08,907
Everyone on your team has a role to play

93
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:10,641
in the design of your service.

94
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:12,675
Their unique perspectives might identify

95
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:14,887
solutions no one else can see.

96
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,146
Collaboration leads to better designs,

97
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:18,888
which is why we're careful not to get

98
00:04:18,888 --> 00:04:21,355
stuck in silos of our own making.

99
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:24,100
We talk to people, look
at other teams' walls,

100
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,187
ask questions, seek help, seek feedback.

101
00:04:27,187 --> 00:04:31,229
We share our ideas and our
failures early, explore them,

102
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,959
build on what works,
and adopt them together.

103
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,349
And of course, the service should be

104
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:37,801
designed so that everyone can use it.

105
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:39,877
Most importantly, digital transformation

106
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:43,787
isn't just service design,
it's organisation design.

107
00:04:43,787 --> 00:04:45,631
It's as much about people as it

108
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:48,290
is about pixels and processes.

109
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,584
- We don't want to be working in a world

110
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:54,832
where we're constantly scrambling
just to make ends meet.

111
00:04:54,832 --> 00:04:56,239
We want to be able to do it in a way

112
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,890
that we understand why
we're all doing things.

113
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,827
We can collectively as an
organisation make better choices

114
00:05:02,827 --> 00:05:06,035
about priorities if we're better aligned.

115
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:09,156
And the alignment around
our user-centered design,

116
00:05:09,156 --> 00:05:10,823
we're aligned around

117
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,144
not an idea of saying, "What do you need?

118
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:17,011
"Okay, I'll build it for you."

119
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:18,141
What's your problem?

120
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:20,394
How can we solve it together?

121
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:22,019
- [Narrator] In government,
we are designing

122
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:24,294
something that people have to use.

123
00:05:24,294 --> 00:05:27,768
Unlike with the private sector,
they don't have a choice.

124
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:30,846
A good design process allows
us to balance the outcomes

125
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:34,234
that government are looking
for with the needs of users.

126
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:35,929
When the balance is right and our users'

127
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:38,679
needs are met, everyone benefits.
