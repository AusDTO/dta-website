1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,287

2
00:00:11,587 --> 00:00:13,809
- [Narrator] We all have
to use government services.

3
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:14,658
So, to give our users

4
00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:17,769
a government experience that's
fit for the 21st century,

5
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:19,928
we need to make sure
that interacting with us

6
00:00:19,928 --> 00:00:22,109
is easy and efficient.

7
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,109
To help us do this,

8
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:24,819
we're introducing a new approach,

9
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:26,709
underpinned by a set of principles

10
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:28,659
called the Digital Service Standard.

11
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:30,840
It's grounded in user-centered design

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,029
and puts humans,

13
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:34,189
the people who use and
deliver our services,

14
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:36,779
at the centre of everything we do.

15
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:37,787
The first step

16
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,509
is to really get to
know who your users are

17
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:42,099
and their context.

18
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:45,589
And when we say users, we mean all users.

19
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:49,112
- Like looking out a million
windows all over the country

20
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:50,491
and seeing the world around you

21
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:52,933
and everybody that you walk past is a user

22
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:55,189
with their own story, their own history

23
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:56,309
that makes their experience

24
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,221
of dealing with government unique.

25
00:00:58,221 --> 00:00:59,309
Our colleagues in government

26
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,500
are users of the overall service as well.

27
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,894
And helping make their
experience and their tools better

28
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:07,733
can be the most effective way

29
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:10,274
to improving end-users' experience too.

30
00:01:10,274 --> 00:01:12,712
- [Narrator] You should spend
time learning about people

31
00:01:12,712 --> 00:01:15,482
in the context that they use your service.

32
00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:16,634
What's really happening?

33
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:17,882
Find out what they're doing now

34
00:01:17,882 --> 00:01:19,893
to solve the problem you're working on.

35
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:21,554
Where are the pain points?

36
00:01:21,554 --> 00:01:23,522
What are their common needs?

37
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:25,394
Flex your empathy muscle.

38
00:01:25,394 --> 00:01:27,322
It's the most important tool you have.

39
00:01:27,322 --> 00:01:28,802
When we do our early research,

40
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:29,994
we're not looking for evidence

41
00:01:29,994 --> 00:01:32,081
to validate our project's existence,

42
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:34,052
or something that we've already announced.

43
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,263
We're looking for nothing more

44
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:38,133
than a rich understanding
of how are users are.

45
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:40,242
We need to expand our thinking

46
00:01:40,242 --> 00:01:42,343
way beyond the borders of The Department.

47
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:44,002
It's about being curious,

48
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:45,282
keeping an open mind,

49
00:01:45,282 --> 00:01:47,961
and trying to avoid unconscious biases.

50
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:49,213
We asked some user researchers

51
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:51,591
how it feels to learn
from users in this way.

52
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:52,943
- If you sit someone down,

53
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:55,893
and you ask them to go through a screen

54
00:01:55,893 --> 00:01:58,311
and try and select their birthday,

55
00:01:58,311 --> 00:01:59,961
and if you can watch them,

56
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:02,126
and you can see their
struggle because it's some

57
00:02:02,126 --> 00:02:03,225
type of calendar

58
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:05,383
or something that they
just don't understand,

59
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:07,567
that's so much more powerful than saying

60
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:10,847
people struggle with
inputting their birthdate.

61
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:12,858
Seeing someone and how they struggle

62
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:14,405
really drives it home

63
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:16,986
that actually, our
assumptions may not be right

64
00:02:16,986 --> 00:02:19,767
because we aren't the user.

65
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:22,407
- [Narrator] And the great news
is that starting with users

66
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:23,517
is more efficient,

67
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:25,517
because we know that the
service we build for them

68
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:27,906
will work right for them, the first time.

69
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:30,266
Nobody wants the
government to waste money.

70
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:32,346
It's our tax dollars after all.

71
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:35,087
Because when a user's
needs aren't met online,

72
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:37,218
they make mistakes that
need to be corrected,

73
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:39,479
they fail to comply with
what's required of them,

74
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,317
or they move to another more
costly, time-consuming channel.

75
00:02:43,317 --> 00:02:46,086
An experience that's frustrating
and difficult for users,

76
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:48,975
and complicated and costly for government.

77
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:50,759
When you start with user needs,

78
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,906
you actually design something

79
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:54,628
they can use and understand straight away.

80
00:02:54,628 --> 00:02:56,656
They can do what they need
to do quickly and easily

81
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:57,887
and move on.

82
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:01,029
This means a better and
cheaper service for everyone,

83
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:04,590
because people will choose
to use the digital service.

84
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,922
To get to know your users,

85
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:07,586
start with their stories.

86
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:09,295
Every user has one.

87
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,162
Of course, data is important too.

88
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:12,803
We build in layers of learning

89
00:03:12,803 --> 00:03:14,485
by combining statistical data

90
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,444
with our qualitative research.

91
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:17,636
Here's how we do that.

92
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:19,797
- You can start to build a
story of their mental model

93
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:21,935
and start to understand
what they're thinking

94
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,962
when they go through the screens,

95
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:26,026
and why they're getting stuck,

96
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:28,814
and if they're getting
stuck at that point,

97
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:29,984
why continue?

98
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:31,957
Let's actually take that prototype back

99
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:33,445
and fix what's going wrong.

100
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:36,575
And we repeat that for
lots of different users,

101
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:40,592
and lots of different people
in lots of different locations.

102
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:42,775
- [Narrator] But you don't
only start with users.

103
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:44,186
You keep going.

104
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:46,285
We stay connected from our early research

105
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:48,746
right through development and beyond.

106
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:52,135
We keep asking, testing,
validating and measuring.

107
00:03:52,135 --> 00:03:54,197
This is how we avoid
building false assumptions

108
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:55,725
into our services,

109
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:57,866
and learn whether our
design is doing its job,

110
00:03:57,866 --> 00:04:00,496
and what we need to do
to keep making it better.

111
00:04:00,496 --> 00:04:03,117
And when everyone in the
team understands their users,

112
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,887
they can all make smarter
decisions, quicker.

113
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:07,407
- One staff said to our client,

114
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:09,348
"I don't understand what you're saying.”

115
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:12,337
"Don't speak military to me.”

116
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:14,980
"Explain it in plain English."

117
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,980
To this guy,

118
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:19,752
all he's every known is military.

119
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:22,563
From the age of 17, his
father was in the military,

120
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:25,131
his mother was in the military.

121
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,654
That's the language he knows.

122
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:29,384
If he's going to tell
you about his service,

123
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:31,214
he's got answers to your questions,

124
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:35,191
that's the only way he knows
how to explain it to you.

125
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,763
That touched me when
he told me that story,

126
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:39,839
because I thought, well,

127
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,083
how can we say that to someone
when that's their life?

128
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,202
- [Narrator] What's also great

129
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,012
is that understanding user needs

130
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:47,910
is not one person's job.

131
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,420
It's a team sport.

132
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,854
It's everybody's job.

133
00:04:50,854 --> 00:04:52,802
Understanding user needs is vital

134
00:04:52,802 --> 00:04:55,752
for every single one of us, every time.

135
00:04:55,752 --> 00:04:57,220
A user-centered approach

136
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,921
doesn't have to wait until
you're designing a service.

137
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:01,632
You can be actively empathetic

138
00:05:01,632 --> 00:05:03,672
in the smallest things you do,

139
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:06,312
and you'll notice your actions
are much more effective.

140
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:08,342
So how could you bring
a little more empathy

141
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,632
into your day starting right now?

142
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:11,992
Start by thinking about

143
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:14,843
how you can find out what your users need.

144
00:05:14,843 --> 00:05:17,243
What is working well, or not so well,

145
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:18,882
for them right now?

146
00:05:18,882 --> 00:05:19,992
Most importantly,

147
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:22,512
we now have an opportunity
to really make a difference

148
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:23,862
to people's lives.

149
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:26,713
- I think it's a pretty natural

150
00:05:26,713 --> 00:05:31,152
thing that most of us feel is
that if we can help others,

151
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:32,869
we feel satisfied ourselves.

152
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:35,446
I think that's where it all sort of stems from.

153
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:38,113
