1
00:00:00,411 --> 00:00:02,994

2
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:15,133
- [Narrator] The world is changing fast.

3
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:18,139
Despite our best intentions,
many government services

4
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:20,209
are being left behind.

5
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:22,134
To make government fit
for the 21st century,

6
00:00:22,134 --> 00:00:24,772
we're introducing a new
and better way of working

7
00:00:24,772 --> 00:00:28,884
and the Digital Service
Standard will be your guide.

8
00:00:28,884 --> 00:00:33,332
So here is the Digital Service
Standard in Plain English.

9
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:34,569
Here's some people.

10
00:00:34,569 --> 00:00:39,165
Jack, Jill, Me, you, my mom, your dad,

11
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:41,513
the guy who makes you
coffee in the morning,

12
00:00:41,513 --> 00:00:44,152
your GP and his grandad.

13
00:00:44,152 --> 00:00:46,623
All of them use government services

14
00:00:46,623 --> 00:00:47,779
because to get things done,

15
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:50,189
we need to use government services.

16
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:51,565
If they want a holiday in Europe,

17
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:55,015
they'll need to get a passport and so on.

18
00:00:55,015 --> 00:00:56,184
For some of them, it's easy.

19
00:00:56,184 --> 00:00:58,895
For others, it's not so easy.

20
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:00,963
Some services are transactional.

21
00:01:00,963 --> 00:01:02,917
Others just give you
information to help you

22
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:04,555
make decisions about things.

23
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:06,823
All of them use some IT.

24
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:09,394
We want them to become more
digital because they're

25
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:14,377
simple, clear, and fast, and it's cheaper.

26
00:01:14,377 --> 00:01:16,224
Services are delivered
by government agencies,

27
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:19,402
that's us, using bits of technology,

28
00:01:19,402 --> 00:01:21,800
usually provided by big suppliers

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,911
through long-term contracts.

30
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:26,204
It's expensive, it's hard to change,

31
00:01:26,204 --> 00:01:28,917
and usually, it's not that great.

32
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:31,126
This is what people tell us all the time.

33
00:01:31,126 --> 00:01:34,196
It needs to change and the
way we're gonna change it

34
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:36,883
is to make new technology
services delivered

35
00:01:36,883 --> 00:01:39,484
over the internet, but we
won't be going it alone.

36
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:42,363
We'll be doing it together, guided by the

37
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,078
Digital Service Standard.

38
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:45,807
Let's break it down.

39
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:50,408
A service is made up of people,
process, and technology.

40
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:52,789
When our starting point is people,

41
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:55,203
my mom, the guy who makes you coffee,

42
00:01:55,203 --> 00:01:57,867
and understanding what
they're trying to do

43
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,340
in their busy lives.

44
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,788
We can make a better service
and we can do it faster

45
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:06,244
if we, that's us in government,
have all the right people

46
00:02:06,244 --> 00:02:09,663
with the right skills
making the service together,

47
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,973
continually checking in with users.

48
00:02:11,973 --> 00:02:16,275
This way, we know we're
making the right thing.

49
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:18,333
Then we come to the process part.

50
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:22,500
We spend time learning what
people need then ask ourselves,

51
00:02:23,587 --> 00:02:25,467
how might we meet that need?

52
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:27,494
We build some prototypes
and we ask people,

53
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:31,929
my mom and the guy who makes
you coffee, to try them out.

54
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:34,794
We learn from how people
use our prototypes

55
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:37,348
and then we build what works best

56
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:39,738
and start operating the service.

57
00:02:39,738 --> 00:02:43,953
And that brings us to the
exciting part, the technology.

58
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:45,880
Let's make it simple.

59
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,546
Our services are made up of layers.

60
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:51,282
The first layer is where
people interact with us

61
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:55,160
via a paper form, a
telephone call, or commonly,

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,075
a website or app.

63
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:59,872
We present information
to people on this layer.

64
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:03,638
If we use words that people
understand, they'll get it.

65
00:03:03,638 --> 00:03:07,445
We also need to make sure
people can access our services

66
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:09,714
and that they don't have
to tell us the same things

67
00:03:09,714 --> 00:03:12,477
over and over, making it easier for people

68
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:14,186
to get things done.

69
00:03:14,186 --> 00:03:17,411
The next layer is where all
the service-y things go.

70
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:22,058
These can be service specific
things like calculating tax,

71
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:25,812
or it might be something that
is used across many services

72
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:29,107
like making a payment, verifying identity,

73
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:32,884
or making sure things
are kept safe and secure.

74
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:34,883
Or they could be machinery kind of things

75
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:38,419
like sophisticated IT services, databases,

76
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,502
storage, mainframes, etc.

77
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:43,499
And as everything become more digital,

78
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:47,275
we become able to build
services in a modular way

79
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:50,313
using modular parts
that can be swapped out

80
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,266
without effecting other
parts and if we need to,

81
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,674
we can buy different parts
from different suppliers

82
00:03:56,674 --> 00:04:00,090
instead of all of it from just one or two.

83
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,019
As we go through each of our
services, untangling them,

84
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:05,544
we'll know what all the common parts are

85
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:08,680
and then we can borrow
those parts from each other,

86
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,286
improving them as we need,
or just reusing them.

87
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:14,590
They cost a lot so we
don't want to keep on

88
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,366
buying the same parts every
time we have the same need.

89
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:20,474
By sharing parts, we
don't have to build things

90
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:21,904
from scratch every time.

91
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:24,560
This way, we save more
money and we can make

92
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,491
new services better, cheaper, and faster.

93
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:30,502
Oh, just one more thing.

94
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:34,697
Making our new services
in this way is a big job.

95
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:38,716
We've got lots of services and
lots of people who use them.

96
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:41,842
If we can stay on top of what's
happening for those people

97
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:44,127
and respond to their needs quickly,

98
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:46,162
then people will have more trust

99
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:48,042
in what we do here in government.

100
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:49,883
So as you build new services,

101
00:04:49,883 --> 00:04:52,260
make sure you tell people, yep,

102
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,276
my mom and the coffee guy,
you've made a new service.

103
00:04:56,276 --> 00:04:59,387
Invite them to try it out
and make sure you give them

104
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:02,420
an easy way to let you know
if it does the job for them.

105
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,400
That way, you'll be sure
to know what's working

106
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,625
and what's not, so you can
continue to make it even better,

107
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,883
and pretty soon, more
and more people will use

108
00:05:11,883 --> 00:05:16,327
the new services because
they're simple, clear, and fast.

109
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:20,327
And that friends is the
Digital Service Standard

110
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:22,712
in Plain English.

111
00:05:22,712 --> 00:05:26,795
Try it out and be sure to
let us know how you go.
