1
00:00:01,655 --> 00:00:04,905

2
00:00:14,518 --> 00:00:16,487
We have the opportunity with technology

3
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:19,504
to provide far better services
than we have in the past

4
00:00:19,504 --> 00:00:22,738
Then making it easy is the key.

5
00:00:22,738 --> 00:00:25,415
- Often people with a
disability have to interact

6
00:00:25,415 --> 00:00:27,268
with Government departments a lot

7
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:30,726
and a general way of getting
someone to fill in a form

8
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,919
is to send it out in the mail.

9
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:37,517
Well, it just doesn't work
for people who are paralysed.

10
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:38,742
- If you don't have the language skills

11
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:40,768
or the technical skills
in terms of being able

12
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:42,658
to use the system in the way it's

13
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:45,973
previously been designed,
it can make you frustrated.

14
00:00:45,973 --> 00:00:47,634
- Users shouldn't have to understand

15
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:50,244
Government to deal with Government.

16
00:00:50,244 --> 00:00:52,354
- People have no choice with Government,

17
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:55,448
so we have this deep moral
obligation to make sure

18
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:58,460
that what we're doing in
Government everybody can use.

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,596
- The citizen, they've got
to get on with their life.

20
00:01:00,596 --> 00:01:01,674
So they want whatever they have

21
00:01:01,674 --> 00:01:04,822
to do with Government to be easy.

22
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:06,350
- The important thing for us is

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,252
to focus on the opportunities.

24
00:01:08,252 --> 00:01:09,745
They are very significant here.

25
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:12,046
Reinventing Government
and at the heart of that

26
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:14,927
it means a different
way of doing government.

27
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:17,738
- We looked all around the world
between the private sector,

28
00:01:17,738 --> 00:01:19,590
the public sector and we said,

29
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,575
"What is best practise in
service design and delivery?"

30
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:26,205
So the Standard is a set
of principles, if you like,

31
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:28,697
around how we will design
and deliver services.

32
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:30,767
- Those core principles of building

33
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:32,009
yourself around the user.

34
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,290
- A set of really pragmatic
guidelines that are grounded

35
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,707
in experience and starts with user first.

36
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:46,478
- Users, design,
simplicity, adaptability.

37
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,755
If we design with users
in mind the whole time,

38
00:01:49,755 --> 00:01:52,758
be they an end user, a
user within the ecosystem

39
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:56,171
of a service, then we get a
service that we know will work.

40
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:58,731
- We do need to take the
time to think through

41
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:01,150
how we can make things
simpler and clearer for them.

42
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,329
- That's what working in a
digital world is gonna be.

43
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,641
We have to be mindful
that life will move on.

44
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:08,579
We have to change our minds.

45
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:12,187
- It's about transforming
people and how we work.

46
00:02:12,187 --> 00:02:13,584
It's not about technology.

47
00:02:13,584 --> 00:02:14,961
It is not the bricks.

48
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:17,091
It is the mortar that matters.

49
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:18,648
- No one likes to change.

50
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:19,640
Let's be honest.

51
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,579
It's hard because it means
getting out of your comfort zone.

52
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,816
It means looking at
problems in a different way.

53
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:26,280
And it means listening to answers

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,529
that you don't want to hear.

55
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:28,827
- We already have runs on the board.

56
00:02:28,827 --> 00:02:30,496
We actually need to remember that.

57
00:02:30,496 --> 00:02:32,947
- You can stand around and
wait for someone else to do it,

58
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:35,591
but part of your role
in the Public Service

59
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:38,835
is to stand up and say, "Well,
now, we're gonna do this,

60
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:40,360
and this is how we're gonna do it."

61
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,790
- If Australians interact with
government, and at the end

62
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,976
of each of those interactions,
they say, "That was easy,"

63
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:49,643
I think we've had a huge impact.
