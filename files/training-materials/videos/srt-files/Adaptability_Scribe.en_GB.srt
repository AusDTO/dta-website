1
00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:14,626
- [Narrator] This is the age of digital disruption.

2
00:00:14,626 --> 00:00:16,732
Technology is transforming
the way businesses,

3
00:00:16,732 --> 00:00:20,153
organisations and governments
engage with the world.

4
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,352
Organisations that least
expect it are finding

5
00:00:22,352 --> 00:00:25,219
themselves becoming
'technology organisations'.

6
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:27,488
That's why it's so important
that we challenge each other

7
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:29,539
to work in a new way.

8
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,579
A way that is quick to respond
when circumstances change

9
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,825
and adapt when we learn new things.

10
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:36,579
For some of us, it will be a welcome shift

11
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,569
to an approach we know works.

12
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:40,679
For others it will be foreign.

13
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,038
And like anything new,

14
00:00:42,038 --> 00:00:44,807
it might feel scary and uncomfortable,

15
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:46,969
but it is absolutely worth doing

16
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:49,347
and many organisations are
already seeing the progress

17
00:00:49,347 --> 00:00:52,187
that new ways of working brings.

18
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:54,913
Following the Digital Service
Standard means you'll be sure

19
00:00:54,913 --> 00:00:56,942
to be building the right thing.

20
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:59,988
The thing that meets users' needs.

21
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:03,710
Until now, government has
built services in a linear way

22
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,590
with delivery at the end
of a project timeframe.

23
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,121
We follow the plan, over
many months or years,

24
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:11,281
only to be smacked in the face by reality.

25
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:12,139
The thing we've spent

26
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,430
so long building doesn't meet users' needs

27
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,393
because we never found
out what those needs were.

28
00:01:17,393 --> 00:01:19,675
Our new way of building is different.

29
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:22,372
Using an agile delivery
approach, we spend time learning

30
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:24,449
about users' needs first

31
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:27,069
so we can be sure to
design the right thing.

32
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:28,370
- Agility and the ways of working

33
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,373
that the Service Standard
brings to life aren't new.

34
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:33,619
These are great ways of working

35
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:35,360
that are recognised globally.

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,273
There's movements
happening across the globe

37
00:01:38,273 --> 00:01:40,221
and in different areas and
in different industries,

38
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:42,067
so private sector we're
seeing amazing stuff

39
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,811
that the different
organisations are doing there

40
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:45,491
from an agility point of view,

41
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:47,437
and there's definitely an
opportunity for the government

42
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:50,562
and public sector to
leverage those as well.

43
00:01:50,562 --> 00:01:53,080
- [Narrator] Working in iterative
cycles, we build quickly,

44
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,211
test what we've built
and evolve our work based

45
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:58,030
on constant measuring and testing.

46
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,649
By putting our concepts and prototypes

47
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:02,075
in front of real users,
we can adapt and refine

48
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:04,364
as we observe their behaviours.

49
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:06,669
- One of the teams I assessed
in the childcare space,

50
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:09,401
they were out there testing
the childcare centre

51
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:12,473
in the morning, making changes
at lunch, and back out there

52
00:02:12,473 --> 00:02:15,317
in the afternoon for the kids' pick-up.

53
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:17,971
- [Narrator] Adaptability depends on flexibility.

54
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,039
You'll see in the Standard

55
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,776
that we have moved to
multidisciplinary teams,

56
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:24,617
which have all the specialist
skills to research, design,

57
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:27,619
build, operate, and measure the service.

58
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:30,761
We often say the unit
of delivery is the team.

59
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:33,200
What's great about the
multidisciplinary team is

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,312
that it has a flexible structure.

61
00:02:35,312 --> 00:02:38,742
It changes and adapts at
various stages of the process.

62
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,605
The flexible structure
applies to the environment

63
00:02:40,605 --> 00:02:43,292
that supports our
multidisciplinary teams, too.

64
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:44,829
Agile working environments are designed

65
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:47,075
to support maximum collaboration,

66
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:49,276
which means breaking
down physical barriers

67
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:52,792
and hacking the workspace,
because teams need easy ways

68
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:54,646
to coordinate their activities,

69
00:02:54,646 --> 00:02:57,741
communicate progress, and collaborate.

70
00:02:57,741 --> 00:02:59,716
But to make adaptability possible,

71
00:02:59,716 --> 00:03:02,487
we need to build services
that allow us to change.

72
00:03:02,487 --> 00:03:04,789
We need flexibility of technology.

73
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:06,013
So, when you're deciding

74
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:08,110
on the infrastructure
you're gonna work with,

75
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,124
it's important to make
choices that enable you

76
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:12,396
to change your mind at a later stage,

77
00:03:12,396 --> 00:03:15,153
adapting your technology
and all of its components

78
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,648
as your understanding of how

79
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:19,304
to meet your user needs changes.

80
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:21,464
We can respond quickly to what we learn

81
00:03:21,464 --> 00:03:23,464
and make changes seamlessly.

82
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:25,638
What's really important
is that our decisions

83
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,886
to change and adapt are driven by data.

84
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:32,507
Data drives decision-making,
not hunches or guesswork.

85
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:34,803
And preference doesn't get a vote.

86
00:03:34,803 --> 00:03:38,069
We focus on what works, not what's liked.

87
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:39,809
We constantly gather data as we measure

88
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:42,689
how well our service
is working with users.

89
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,268
That means measuring how
well the system is performing

90
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:48,515
and how people are interacting
with it in real time.

91
00:03:48,515 --> 00:03:50,952
As well as all our qualitative insights,

92
00:03:50,952 --> 00:03:52,565
we use data analytics to help us

93
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,417
in developing and refining the service.

94
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:59,012
They should be built-in,
always on and easy to read.

95
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:00,944
They're an essential tool.

96
00:04:00,944 --> 00:04:01,777
- How we can start making some

97
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:04,981
of those data-driven
decisions around what we do

98
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:08,273
in our service, so not just
reporting on the things

99
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:10,301
that we wanna see or that
we're currently interested

100
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:14,545
in this month, but actually
taking a user-centered approach

101
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,062
to everything that we're doing
and putting the user really

102
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:18,545
at the heart of even these metrics.

103
00:04:18,545 --> 00:04:20,400
I mean we do it with the
service transformation.

104
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,767
We're putting it at the
heart of our dashboard

105
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:25,007
and the metrics we have, just
to understand their behaviours

106
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:27,011
and what they're doing, will really help

107
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:29,770
to continue building that
empathy that we kind of encourage

108
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,541
throughout the whole journey
of service transformation.

109
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,181
- [Narrator] The agile mindset is one of adaptability.

110
00:04:36,181 --> 00:04:37,958
We diverge and converge.

111
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,850
Expand and contract.

112
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,189
We know we're asking you
to think differently.

113
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:43,269
It's change.

114
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:46,080
And change can be uncomfortable,
but it's worth it,

115
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,609
because this is our opportunity

116
00:04:47,609 --> 00:04:50,000
to build the right thing in the right way

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,745
and make a real difference
to people's lives.

118
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:56,412
And we're here to support
you along the way.
