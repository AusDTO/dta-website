We have released the first component of the [Trusted Digital Identity Framework](/what-we-do/policies-and-programs/identity/) â€” an important milestone in the development of a digital identity solution for Australia.

The framework outlines the robust accreditation standards organisations must meet in order to be accredited to provide digital identity services.

The DTA consulted with the financial sector, privacy advocates, digital identity experts and the public to develop the standards. More than 1,000 comments were received through public consultation which helped to shape the framework.  

The framework outlines requirements for security, usability, privacy protection, accessibility, fraud protection and risk management.

This component of the framework outlines the standards for identity services for individuals. Later this year we will release additional components which will manage an offline option for creating a digital identity and standards to authorise individuals to act on behalf of a business.

These components will help remove the barriers for people who do not have the required documentation to create their digital identity online. It will also simplify the interactions business people have to have with government to get their work done.

You can [read the ten documents](/what-we-do/policies-and-programs/identity/) which make up the framework and we have also published a summary of the feedback received during consultation.

The other part of the digital identity system is the [verification and authentication technology](https://www.dta.gov.au/blog/creating-a-govpass-digital-identity/) which is currently in beta development.
