Great talent was on show this week at the Digital Canberra [iAwards](https://www.aiia.com.au/?page=iawards) with some of Canberra’s top ICT innovation leaders, start-ups, entrepreneurs and students honoured for their work.

Amongst the winners were several examples of great government innovation.

The National Blood Authority are likely to be on the hunt for a bigger trophy cabinet after picking up no less than four prizes for their [Bloodnet](https://www.nba.gov.au/bloodnet) project. The web-based system automates the real-time exchange of critical blood stocks in hospitals. This frees up hospital staff from the time-consuming job of manually monitoring blood supply and enables them to step-in and quickly address any problems.

[The Dandelion Program](https://www.iawards.com.au/history/2015/winners/act) – a collaboration between Hewlett Packard Australia, the Department of Human Services and Specialisterne, known as the Specialist People Foundation – picked up an award in the society domain. Their collaboration offers people with Autism Spectrum Disorder a way to leverage their strengths and gain skilled employment in the field of ICT software testing.

Organised criminals should be looking over their shoulder with the Australian Crime Commission-led [National Criminal Intelligence Fusion Capability](https://www.crimecommission.gov.au/organised-crime/joint-task-forces-and-initiatives/national-criminal-intelligence-fusion-capability) to support the response to serious and organised crime. For their award-winning project, the Commission brought together subject matter experts, investigators and analysts, data and tools across all levels of government to generate intelligence to better respond to serious and organised criminal threats. This has led to the discovery of previously unknown criminal threats and links between organisations.
