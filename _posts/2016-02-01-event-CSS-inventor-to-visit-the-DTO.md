When Bert Bos co-invented Cascading Style Sheets - or CSS - more than 20 years ago, not even he realised the impact it would have on website design and promoting accessibility. 

Most websites today use the cornerstone technology to create visually engaging web pages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile apps. Separating the content from the presentation of a website helps us create responsive sites that meet the needs of mobile users and helps address accessibility to meet the needs of people with disability.

Learn more about where CSS is at, its role in responsive web design and where it’s headed at a special event at the Digital Transformation Office in Canberra. If you're in Sydney there's a [Web Developers Meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/web-developers-meetup-css-svg-houdini-registration-20098723824) on Wednesday.
