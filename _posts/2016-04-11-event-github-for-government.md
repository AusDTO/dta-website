*Image: GitHub helps you collaborate on code, data, or policy, within your organisation or with the public.*

To build digital services that meet user needs, developers must collaborate when shipping code.

Teams need tools that help them experiment with ideas in code. Future maintainers need to know what the original authors were thinking. What if there were tools that helped both users?

Over the past 10 years [Git](https://git-scm.com/) has become the de facto standard for version controlling code changes, and [GitHub](https://github.com/) has emerged as the the platform for teams to collaborate when solving problems together.

More than [600 government organisations](https://government.github.com/community/) around the world use GitHub to collaborate on code, data, and policy.

At this workshop, the GitHub team will walk you through what the GitHub workflow looks like: from idea, to code running in front of users. Weâ€™ll cover fast iteration with branches, collaboration and code review with [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), and accelerated feedback loops with continuous integration.
