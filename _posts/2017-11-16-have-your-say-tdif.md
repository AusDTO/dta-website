The DTA is looking for your [feedback](https://engage.digital.gov.au/) on our draft Trusted Digital Identity Framework.

The framework outlines the important rules and standards for the government’s digital identity program, Govpass. 

Govpass will make it easier for people to access government services by being able to prove their identity online. The program includes the development of a [technology platform](https://www.dta.gov.au/blog/creating-a-govpass-digital-identity/) as well as the Trusted Digital Identity Framework.

We have been working with privacy and industry groups as well as government agencies to help shape the draft framework. While we’re continuing to consider the feedback received to date, we want to know what you think.  

There are 14 key documents that make up the framework. These detail requirements including the process for accrediting providers, privacy and security considerations, risk and fraud management, as well as outlining standards for usability and accessibility.

It is essential that we spend the time to get the framework right. It will provide the foundation to make sure we deliver a consistent approach to digital identity across Australia --- for both users and identity providers. 

You can provide [feedback](https://engage.digital.gov.au/) online until Friday 8 December. We’ll be publishing a summary of the feedback we receive as well as how it will be addressed in early 2018.
