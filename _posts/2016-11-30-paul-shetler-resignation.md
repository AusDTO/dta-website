The Digital Transformation Agency has today announced the resignation of the government’s Chief Digital Officer, Paul Shetler.
 
Mr Shetler was appointed Chief Digital Officer on 22 October 2016 and was the inaugural Chief Executive Officer of the Digital Transformation Office from July 2015.
 
Interim Chief Executive Officer Nerida O’Loughlin said Mr Shetler had played an instrumental role in establishing the Australian Government’s agenda to transform its digital presence and service delivery.
 
“Paul’s wealth of knowledge and international experience in the field of digital services has been invaluable to the government's digital ambitions,” Ms O’Loughlin said.
 
“His creativity and vision have been a great inspiration and have been crucial in helping the government to deliver the first phase of its digital transformation agenda. This has included the delivery of six transformed ‘exemplar’ services and the establishment of the highly successful Digital Marketplace. 
 
“On behalf of the agency, I thank Paul for his significant contribution and wish him well for the future.”
 
Ms O’Loughlin said that the agency expected to fill the Chief Digital Officer role in the new year.
