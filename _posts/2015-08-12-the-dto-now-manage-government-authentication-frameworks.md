The Digital Transformation Office is now responsible for a number of authentication frameworks which it inherited from the Department of Finance on 1 July 2015.
These frameworks include:

- The *National e-Authentication Framework*, which are a suite of better practice guides for implementing digital authentication systems;</li>
- The *Gatekeeper Public Key Infrastructure Framework*, which is a whole-of-government accreditation program for the use of public key technology by Government agencies; and
- The *Third Party Identity Services Assurance Framework*, which is an accreditation framework for the use of commercially provided digital authentication services by Government agencies. These services include personal data vaults, digital mailboxes, data verification services and authentication services.

We’ll be adding these frameworks and status of accredited service providers to the DTO website over the coming weeks. If you’d like a copy of these documents or service provider status in the interim, please contact us at [authentication@dto.gov.au](mailto:authentication@dto.gov.au)
