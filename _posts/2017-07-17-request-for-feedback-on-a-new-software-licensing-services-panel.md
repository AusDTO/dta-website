Initially, the panel will have one category --â€“ Microsoft Licensing. In the future, more categories will be added for other software licensing and related services. Dates for additional categories are not yet set. 

From March 2018, non-corporate Commonwealth entities will be required to use the Microsoft Licensing category of the panel if they choose to purchase Microsoft software. The panel category will replace the
[existing reseller arrangement for Microsoft licensing](https://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.son.view&SONUUID=0F279B6E-D833-4077-62FD9AACE4EF582E){:target="_blank"} that is due to expire in March 2018. 

The panel will also be available for government business enterprises and state and territory governments to use.
