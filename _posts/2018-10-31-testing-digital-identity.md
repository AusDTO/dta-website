searchexcerpt: The Australian Government has started testing myGovID with real people and services.

---
We’ve been working across government to deliver a safe and secure [digital identity program](https://beta.dta.gov.au/our-projects/digital-identity). This includes the Commonwealth’s digital identity provider, myGovID.

To make sure we get it right, myGovID is being built and delivered in an agile way. This means we’ll be testing and refining the system in controlled environments before it becomes more widely available.

Today, we announced the start of the first pilot program. myGovID will be tested with a new online system for tax file number (TFN) applications. This is the first time myGovID will be used by real people for a real service, and using real data.

The current process for applying for a TFN involves completing a form, printing it and then taking it with your identity documents to a post office. The myGovID pilot brings this entire process online, reducing the waiting time for a TFN from up to a month to just minutes.

Participants in the pilot will be the first people to set up a myGovID, and to use it for a real service.
More pilots with different government services will follow over the coming months, allowing more people and businesses to get a myGovID and test the program.
