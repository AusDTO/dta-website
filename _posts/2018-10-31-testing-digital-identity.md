searchexcerpt: The Australian Government has started testing myGovID with real people and services.

---
We’ve been working across government to deliver a safe and secure [digital identity program](https://beta.dta.gov.au/our-projects/digital-identity). This includes the Commonwealth’s digital identity provider, myGovID.

To make sure we get it right, myGovID is being built and delivered in an agile way. This means we’ll be testing and refining the system in controlled environments before it becomes more widely available.

Today, we announced the start of the first pilot program. myGovID will be tested with a new online system for tax file number (TFN) applications. This is the first time myGovID will be used by real people for a real service, and using real data.

The current process for applying for a TFN involves completing a form, printing it and then taking it with your identity documents to a post office. The myGovID pilot brings this entire process online, reducing the waiting time for a TFN from up to a month to just minutes.

Participants in the pilot will be the first people to set up a myGovID, and to use it for a real service.

More pilots with different government services will follow over the coming months, allowing more people and businesses to get a myGovID and test the program.  

Watch our video to get a simple overview of how people will experience myGovID.

Voiceover - female voice: You use your phone to shop pay bills and keep up to date with friends and family. Soon your phone will also help you access government services with myGovID.

myGovID is your digital identity. It's like 100 points of ID which you can use to safely and securely access government services online creating your myGovID is easy. After downloading the app start with your email address. A verification code will then be emailed to you.

You then need to enter the details from your identity documents like your Australian driver's licence, passport or Medicare card. Your documents are checked against records the government already has.
To set up your mygovID so it can be used to access government services that require a higher level of security.
You'll need to have your photo taken. Your selfie is electronically checked against your passport photo and then it is discarded.

Your identity is verified and your myGovID is ready to use you only need to go through these steps once. Once it is set up your mygov ID can be used as your proof of identity when you use an online government service so you don't need to visit a shopfront.

It's easy, safe and secure to just sign in with your myGovID. myGovID will be available more widely next year right now a series of pilot programs is underway we're constantly testing and improving the system to make sure we're delivering a secure experience that meets the needs of as many people as possible. Over time myGovID will be connected to more and more online government services so you can get more done when you want and where you want.
