Wouldn’t it be great if you could securely access public services without needing to bring along a dozen forms of ID every time you did?

We want to deliver a way for citizens and businesses to transact with public services simply and securely.

The solution isn’t simple, but we’re committed to developing a Trusted Digital Identity Framework. And we want the Australian community to help us get there.

To start, we’re convening a roundtable – featuring leaders from the consumer, IT, identity policy, security, government, and business sectors.

Next, we’re organising an ‘identity policy workshop’ to start forging the Framework. 

More details coming soon.
