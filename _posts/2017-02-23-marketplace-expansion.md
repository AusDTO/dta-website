*A new seller joins the Digital Marketplace.*

The Digital Transformation Agency has today delivered its expanded Digital Marketplace, allowing new sellers to join and offering a greater range of digital services to government buyers.

DTA interim chief executive officer Nerida O’Loughlin said the latest roll-out would make it simpler for government agencies to find digital services and easier for providers to work with government.

“For our local, state and federal government buyers this means a greater range of expertise is available from companies big and small to deliver a broad range of ICT and digital needs,” Ms O’Loughlin said.  

The new areas of digital expertise include cyber security, data science, content and publishing, marketing, communications and engagement, as well as support and operations.

Special Adviser to the Prime Minister on Cyber Security Alastair MacGibbon praised the Digital Transformation Agency for opening up the marketplace to cyber security experts.

“Governments need to have a strong focus on cyber security and sourcing expertise locally benefits both government and industry,” Mr MacGibbon said.

“I often hear that government procurement methods are a barrier for small cyber security businesses.

“The Digital Marketplace removes some of the pain points, making it much easier for these companies to connect with government. This is about creating opportunities for innovative local firms.”

Ms O’Loughlin said an important feature of the marketplace was its ability to cater to small to medium enterprises.

“The marketplace levels the playing field for sellers who may not previously have worked with government, and, through increased competition, helps government buyers get greater value for money.”

Ms O’Loughlin said another new feature was an option for government buyers to search for services that supported their diversity procurement targets.

“Sellers can badge themselves as a business type including a startup, small-to-medium enterprise, and Indigenous-owned or disability enterprise, which helps government buyers support the growth of a range of different businesses,” Ms O’Loughlin said.

It is expected the expansion of the marketplace will lead to a doubling of the number of registered sellers in the coming weeks.  

The marketplace is being delivered as part of the National Innovation and Science Agenda. To join the Digital Marketplace as a buyer or seller, or to find out more, visit [gov.au/marketplace](https://marketplace.service.gov.au/)
