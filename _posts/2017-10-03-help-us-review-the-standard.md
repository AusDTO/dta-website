---

At the DTA we regularly evaluate and iterate --- not just products but policies as well. This is to make sure that we continue to meet our users’ needs. 

The [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/) (the Standard) has been live for 18 months now, so it’s time to have a look at how it’s going and how our users --- government service teams --- find using it. 

We know that some agencies have been able to use and apply the Standard easily. But for other agencies it’s a bit more difficult. We want to know what’s working well, what’s not so great and what barriers agencies may come across when they’re trying to use that Standard. 

## Get involved

If you’ve used the Standard in your work, it would be great to [get your feedback](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BG8RHYP){:target="_blank"}. 

Over the next few weeks we will also be conducting research interviews with a range of agencies and people who have used the Standard. 

We’ll keep you updated on the process, so check back on our site in a few months. 

## Business as usual

Even though we are having a look at the Standard, we still need to continue using it. ok coIf your service is [in scope](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/scope-of-standard/), you should continue to use the Standard.

Any questions about the research we are doing or the Digital Service Standard can be sent to [standard@digital.gov.au](mailto:standard@digital.gov.au)
