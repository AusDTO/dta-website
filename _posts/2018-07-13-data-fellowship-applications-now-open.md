## What is a data fellowship?

A [data fellowship](https://beta.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/learning-and-development/data-fellowship-program) is a 3 month full-time work placement with the [CSIRO](https://csiro.au)’s data-innovation group [Data61](https://www.data61.csiro.au/en/Who-we-are).

We select high-performing people to step outside their day jobs and create prototypes that improve or completely redesign our approach to real-life problems.

## Who is it for?

Only Australian Public Service employees within Commonwealth entities can apply for this round of data fellowships.

They should be interested in building data skills within their agency and be happy to share their knowledge and expertise with colleagues.

## Past projects

Former participants in our Data Fellowship Program have carried out a variety of data-related projects using a range of techniques.

Some of these projects include:

- machine learning to detect offensive material during forensic investigations to protect staff wellbeing
- empirical modeling to identify and target biosecurity risks at Australian airports
- longitudinal network analysis to see how policy affects how government buys products and services
