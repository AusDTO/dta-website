searchexcerpt: The Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) will be the lead national agency sponsor of GovHack 2018, supporting the innovative use of open data and helping to unlock its potential value.

The annual [GovHack](https://www.govhack.org/) event is an open data hackathon in which teams of developers, coders, designers, analysts and others use open data to develop solutions and services aimed at benefiting the broader community.

Open data is publicly-available data that anyone can access, use or share. It holds a potential wealth of information. Recent research suggests making data publicly available for re-use could generate up to $25 billion each year.

Last year’s GovHack saw over 3,000 people across 36 locations in Australia and New Zealand form teams and work on 430 projects to help generate insights and solve problems for Australia.  

“As the lead national agency sponsor for this year’s event, the DTA will help thousands of local innovators realise the value of open data and the potential benefits it can offer,” DTA Chief Executive Officer Randall Brugeaud said.

In previous years, GovHack participants have visualised data, created 3D models and developed new apps that utilise open data to create services for the public.

“This sponsorship demonstrates the DTA’s ongoing commitment to optimising the use and re-use of open data, while driving collaboration with other sectors to extend the value of open data for the benefit of all Australians,” Mr Brugeaud said.

As part of the [Australian Government’s open data initiative](https://www.pmc.gov.au/public-data/open-data), all national agencies are encouraged to make their data available for re-use on the data.gov.au website. Nearly 30,000 datasets have been published on [data.gov.au](https://search.data.gov.au/) since 2013.

“The DTA is the Government’s lead delivery agency for open data, managing the National Map and data.gov.au,” Mr Brugeaud said. “In this role, we continue to encourage government agencies to make their data available for re-use.

“Soon, we will make it even easier to re-use open data with the launch of a new data.gov.au platform that features greater functionality and search capabilities. This will help innovators like those taking part in this year’s GovHack event to unlock even more value from open data,” Mr Brugeaud said.
