Two key elements of the digital transformation agenda have been released as another step towards changing how the government delivers digital services.
 
Assistant Minister for Digital Transformation Angus Taylor has launched the [digital transformation roadmap](/what-we-do/transformation-agenda/), which sets out the vision, key pieces of work and timelines for the government’s transformation agenda for the next 18 months.
 
The roadmap will be more detailed as government agencies develop their plans to identify what initiatives they will deliver under the transformation agenda.
 
A key feature of the roadmap is what the government expects the user experience to be in the future—that is digital services that are simpler, faster and easier to use.
 
To highlight some improvements users could further expect, Assistant Minister Taylor and Minister for Human Services Alan Tudge released an “alpha” video for the myGov platform.
 
The changes will mean myGov will be easier to use on any device, will have a simpler design and will give users a guided experience so they can create and access their account.
 
Users will also be able to choose simpler log-in options to suit their needs, while the myGov platform will remain highly secure.
 
The myGov changes, set to roll out next year, will build on the improvements made this year. These have included giving users the option to use their email address as a username and the ability to update their details across multiple agencies, as well as improving functionality to the myGov inbox.
