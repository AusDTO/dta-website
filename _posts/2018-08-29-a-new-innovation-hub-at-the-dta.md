searchexcerpt: Today we’re launching our new co-Lab innovation hub to help accelerate cross-government collaboration and digital innovation.

---
Based in Sydney, our [co-Lab](https://beta.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/co-lab-and-events/co-lab-innovation-hub) is a dedicated place for teams across government to work on products in partnership with the DTA and private sector specialists.

The co-Lab team is led by DTA digital experts across content design and strategy, service design, user research, accessibility and agile delivery.

We’ll host 3 types of tailored programs in the space to make sure teams are getting the best outcomes:

- single day experiences for teams to share and learn from others
- multi-week experiences for testing solutions or creating proofs-of-concept
- in-residency experiences for problem-solving initiatives that might span months

Spaces like co-Lab allow us to bring together agencies and align our efforts to design better government services for people and businesses.

We hope that the shared environment of co-Lab will create new partnerships, conversations and ways of working.

This is just the beginning, and we’re looking forward to launching a second co-Lab space in Canberra towards the end of the year.
