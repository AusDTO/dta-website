Have you noticed things are different around here?

We’ve tidied up the layout of our site, used simple icons for easy navigation and made it more compatible with Internet Explorer.

We’ve also added links to our [Digital Service Design Guides](/standard/design-guides/) &mdash; a growing collection of information to help Australian Government agencies meet the [Digital Service Standard](/standard/).

**But we know it can be better.**

We’re not perfect. Not yet. We expect to keep changing our site to better serve the needs of our users. So please, tell us what you think so we can keep transforming our site for the better. Leave your comments here on the blog, or [send us your feedback](mailto:Communications@dto.gov.au).
