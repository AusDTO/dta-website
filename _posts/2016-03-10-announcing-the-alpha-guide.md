Late last year, [we published a guide to the Discovery process](https://www.dto.gov.au/blog/documenting-discovery/), describing our approach to the projects in our Digital Transformation Programme. We received a great response to the content, from both here in Australia and further afield.

Since then, we've been hard at work writing some more guidance, and today we're pleased to share [a detailed guide to the Alpha stage](https://ausdto.github.io/service-handbook/alpha/). The new guide covers the shape of the team, how to build and test prototypes, and choosing the minimum viable product.

We've got another announcement too: we're rolling both of these guides into a new [Service Handbook](https://ausdto.github.io/service-handbook/), which will eventually include everything you need to know to build and operate an excellent digital service. We'll continue to expand and update this over the coming year.

As with the Discovery Guide, we're publishing [all of this in the open on GitHub](https://github.com/ausdto/service-handbook), and we welcome any feedback and suggestions.
