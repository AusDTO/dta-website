We’re throwing open the doors of our Canberra office – come on in!

**We have filled all available spaces for our Open House. You are welcome to join the waitlist by clicking the link below. We'll let you know if space becomes available.**

**Make sure you sign up for blog updates so you hear about our other events as soon as we announce them.**

We’ve just marked the first birthday of the Digital Transformation Office. Over 12 busy months the DTO has changed rapidly – from a lean start-up, to a growing delivery-focused agency working on an expanding list of products. At our Open House we want to share some of the stories from the past year and our vision for the next. 

**DTO is working to make it simpler, clearer, and faster** for the Australian public to access a range of existing government services. 

We are developing whole-of-government platforms like GOV.AU, which will provide a single website that joins up services and information provided by different agencies and tiers of government, so people can get things done with government in a single journey. 

DTO is also building the Digital Marketplace, an online service that will break down the barriers to technology procurement, making it easier for businesses - especially SMEs and start-ups - to help deliver digital services in government. You can hear about these exciting projects and more at the DTO Open House.

**Drop by and see where we work, how we work and why we do what we do.** Throughout the afternoon there will be short presentations by members of the DTO executive team and you’ll have the opportunity to meet staff from across the design, development and delivery teams.

**We’d love to see you so please swing by.**   Registrations are essential so let us know you’re coming using the link below.
