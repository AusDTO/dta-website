As part of the National Innovation and Science Agenda, the DTO is providing more opportunities for businesses with digital expertise to work with government.

As a first step towards this, we’re opening up the market with a new panel for digital and technology specialists. 

The panel will give federal, state and territory governments access to a list of digital suppliers pre-approved to bid for government contracts. 

We think this will give government access to a wide range of innovative and agile suppliers to help us with digital transformation. 

For the DTO and partner agencies having a vetted list of suppliers experienced in agile delivery will certainly make a big difference, particularly for projects that have [timeframes as tight as 20 weeks](https://www.dto.gov.au/our-work/transformation/).

It’s also a good way to ensure quality. To set a high benchmark, we’re asking suppliers to show us their strong track record in delivery. They’ll also need to demonstrate how they can mobilise resources at short notice, and work rapidly across multiple locations. They’ll also be expected to support departments in building and running services that meet our [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/).

The categories that the Digital Specialist Panel covers are:

* Product Management
* Business Analysis
* Delivery Management and Agile Coaching
* User Research
* Service Design and Interaction Design
* Technical Architecture, Development, Ethical Hacking, and Web Operations
* Performance and Web Analytics
* Inclusive Design and Accessibility, and
* Digital Transformation Advisors.

Suppliers don’t need to fulfil all these roles - they can be part of the panel for their expertise in one or more of these skills. 

While this is just the first step towards improving digital procurement, we’ll be taking onboard the learnings for the [Digital Marketplace](https://www.dto.gov.au/blog/making-it-easier-for-startups-and-sme-to-help-government/) which is due to launch in early 2017 .  

Applications are now open. If you’re an experienced supplier interested in providing digital services to government in an agile way, check out the Request for Tender at [www.tenders.gov.au](https://www.tenders.gov.au/). Applications close 4th April 2016.

As part of setting up the panel, the DTO is running a webcast briefing and Q&A session to help potential suppliers understand the process and make it as easy as possible to participate.

**Update: You can now [view the webcast](http://livestream.ssc.gov.au/dto/22march2016/) online. Applications close 4th April 2016.**
