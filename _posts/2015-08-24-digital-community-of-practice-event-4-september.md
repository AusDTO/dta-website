We’ve been working really hard on our design guide and assurance framework and we’re now ready to share our work with you. We’ve had a lot of interest from other agencies, businesses, state and local government, and now here is your chance to participate in our next showcasing event. You will have the opportunity to ask questions as we work together on our journey towards simpler, faster and more humane public services.

You are welcome to <a href="http://livestream.ssc.gov.au/dto/4september2015/">join our webcast</a> for our next speaking event on 4 September 2015, from 10.00am to 12.00pm.
