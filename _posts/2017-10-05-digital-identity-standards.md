The Digital Transformation Agency’s GovPass digital identity project will make the process of proving who you are to government services online simple, safe and secure. 

The project includes the design and delivery of a technical platform as well as a framework of standards --- the Trusted Digital Identity Framework.

The framework is now in a private beta phase.  It sets out the policies and requirements --- including privacy, security, risk and fraud management and standards --- which will build a nationally consistent approach to online identity and establishes best practice for the public and private sectors. 

The DTA has been consulting closely with key stakeholders, including government, industry and privacy advocates over the past 12 months to draft the framework. Public consultation on the framework will begin towards the end of this year.
