searchexcerpt: "Working with users of our services is a core part of the work we do at DTA. In order to design better services for users, we need to test these on real people. Therefore it is in our best interests to intimately understand the issue of consent --- how it is given and what that process looks like. Gillian Bowan, user researcher at the DTA, explores this dynamic and how consent is much more than a checkbox."

To design better services, we need to understand our users. At DTA our team of user researchers work directly with members of the public to better understand and meet their needs.  Consent is a fundamental aspect of how we make sure that what we do poses no risk to those helping us and contributes to products and services that can be used by everyone for the better. 

But consent can’t be captured by a checkbox or skimmed over in the race to the ‘real research’.  While participants are always asked to sign a consent form, the act of giving consent is a process, not a single event. Gaining consent is a process that engages the participant and invites the researcher to carefully observe other nuances. It cannot be taken for granted and must be negotiated.  

## Why we do user research

User research informs the design and development of all the products and services we deliver at the DTA. 

User research begins during the discovery phase of a project, when we develop a broad understanding of the challenges users face when they try to complete particular tasks. It continues once a project moves into the alpha and beta stages as we begin to design and test prototypes with users. 

## Understanding consent 

Like all researchers who work with people, we need informed consent from each person we speak with. In essence, the person is entering into an agreement to perform the tasks we ask them to perform, and to allow us to record and share the findings with our stakeholders. 

In each research activity the researcher explains what’s involved and tells the participant that they will be recorded and observed by people not present, either through a two-way mirror or via webcasting. We remind them they can withdraw or stop at any time, and shouldn’t feel like they have to  answer any questions that may make them uncomfortable. 

We also ask that they sign a consent form. 

## How is consent given? 

A clear, readable consent form is an important aspect of research compliance. But the form plays a relatively small part in what follows. Consent forms promote accountability and facilitate follow up if needed, but a consent form alone, doesn’t give us ‘consent’. At best, it records a verbal agreement between a researcher and a research participant of what is going to happen during and after a session. 

Consent in research is a process, not a single event. It is carefully observed throughout the research session and comprises body language, tone of voice and the responses of the participant to our questions. Researchers allow for silences. We consider whether the person seems comfortable, reflecting on whether they seem anxious, or their participation rushed or forced. We draw them out on topics they want to discuss and move away from areas they’re not comfortable talking about. This is how we ensure that the people we work with genuinely understand and feel comfortable with what they are being asked to do.

When everything is going along as it should, consent becomes part of the background of a shared understanding. But if  a clumsy question is asked, or a misunderstanding arises it moves to the foreground and must be renegotiated. 

User research is not something we do on participants, but something we do with them. It is also something we cannot do without them. Consent is a fundamental aspect of how we make sure that what we do poses no risk to those helping us and contributes to products and services that can be used by everyone for the better.
