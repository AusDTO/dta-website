## Have your say on our draft digital panel policy

Over the past few months an exemplar team worked out of the DTA, researching how the existing ICT Portfolio Panel Policy could be updated to better meet the needs of buyers and sellers of digital products and services.

Along with the DTA, the team was made up of representatives from the Australian Taxation Office, Digital Health Agency and the Departments of Defence, Finance, Human Services and Home Affairs.

Research and engagement with buyers and sellers helped us to better understand the current operating environment and identify areas for improvement.

You told us that existing panel arrangements can be inflexible, hard to join, complicated to use and lacking oversight.  

Today we’re releasing the draft policy principles for feedback to make sure it will improve the experience of buying and selling digital products.

The new draft Digital Panel Policy aims to:
- help agencies source digital products and services
- help government buyers use digital panels
- allow new sellers to join panels more often, especially small and medium enterprises
- help consolidate panels and make them easier to use

We want to hear from anyone who works with digital (including ICT) panels. That’s both people from government agencies and from industry, especially those that sell digital to government, or want to in the future.

Read the draft policy principles and provide your feedback by 12 July 2018.
