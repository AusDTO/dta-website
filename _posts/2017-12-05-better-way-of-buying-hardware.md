At the DTA, we’re always looking for ways to improve the experience of our services for our users. Right now we’re looking at how we can make it easier for government agencies to buy ICT hardware.
 
We are proposing the creation of a hardware marketplace to help you buy the hardware you need, when you need it.

The proposed hardware marketplace will allow government entities to buy ICT hardware to support internal business processes. It will include things like storage, network equipment, and technical and logistical services. We’re planning to have some products and services available from June 2018 with more added over time.

Download the [discussion paper (PDF 991kb)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/files/ict-procurement/17-0059_Hardware-Marketplace_WCAG3.pdf) for more details about how the hardware marketplace might work.

## What do you think?
We’re collecting feedback from our users to make sure this will meet their needs. If you’re a buyer within government or seller who wants to sell ICT hardware to government we’d like to hear from you.

If you would like to give feedback, download the [discussion paper]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/files/ict-procurement/17-0059_Hardware-Marketplace_WCAG3.pdf) and email your feedback to [ictprocurement@dta.gov.au](mailto:ictprocurement@dta.gov.au). We will be collecting feedback until 5pm (Australian eastern daylight time) on 25 January 2018.

We will also be conducting some face-to-face user research sessions. If you’re interested in sharing your feedback in-person, let us know at [ictprocurement@dta.gov.au](mailto:ictprocurement@dta.gov.au)

## Joining the hardware marketplace

There will be an official approach to market in early 2018. Register with AusTender for updates. Don’t worry if you miss out on the first round, we will be adding more products and suppliers in the future.
