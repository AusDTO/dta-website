Across government, the demand for digital capability is growing. 

Assistant Minister for Digital Transformation Angus Taylor said skilled staff were crucial to
delivering effective digital services and the government needs to keep up with the private sector. 

“We want the next group of digital superstars to see government as a great place to start their career”. 

The DTA manages the ICT Entry-Level program which brings new talent into digital roles across government. Up to 1000 people are expected to apply for the current intake in which 200 apprentices and cadets will be placed in government agencies. This is the largest intake in the program's 10 year history which has seen over 1000 people start their digital careers in government.

[Applications for the DTA’s 2018 apprenticeship program](https://www.dta.gov.au/who-we-are/corporate/jobs/) close 4 August and cadetships close 11 August. For more information on entry level training programs visit the DTA [website] (https://www.dta.gov.au/what-we-do/policies-and-programs/ict-entry/). 

The DTA is also working with the Australian Public Service Commission to build capability through a number of digital literacy training programs. These programs are aimed at upskilling staff, developing digital skills at a senior executive level, and attracting and retaining digital talent within the public service.
