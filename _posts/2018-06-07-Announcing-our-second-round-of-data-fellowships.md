We’re pleased to announce our second round of data fellows for 2017-18. We’ve picked 7 talented people to take part in 3-month placements under our [Data Fellowship Program](https://beta.dta.gov.au/data-fellowship-program).

We’ve awarded the fellowships to high-performing data specialists in the Australian Public Service. During their placements they work with data-innovation group [Data61](https://www.data61.csiro.au/en/Who-we-are) to develop solutions for data-related problems or opportunities.

Here are our 7 new data fellows and the projects they’re working on between now and mid-July 2018:

## Checking financial condition reports

Todd Campbell — Australian Prudential Regulation Authority

Todd is looking at how to use text analytics to help identify insights and risks in prudential supervisory reviews of insurance companies’ financial condition reports. He’s also looking at identifying efficiencies and compiling an overview of the industry to assist supervisors.

These documents are currently reviewed manually to identify issues and feed into other risk assessments. Specialist teams also review the documents to help supervisors, and more systematic analysis could assist this process.

## Automating land-use delineation

Rakhesh Devadas — Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (Department of Agriculture and Water Resources)

Rakhesh is developing techniques to automate the way agricultural land uses are mapped at a national scale.

His project will also improve methods for building the Land Use of Australia data series for understanding current and long-term changes in Australian land use.

He’s doing this by developing advanced geospatial data-analysis and modelling techniques. These techniques will combine satellite-derived information and various national datasets.

## Analysing government buying patterns

Patrick Drake-Brockman — Digital Transformation Agency

Patrick’s project will provide data about the way government agencies buy products and services and the sellers they buy from.

He’s using longitudinal network analysis to look at datasets held by AusTender, the website where many contract details are posted. This analysis will show the effects policy changes have on forming networks between government agencies and sellers.

## Detecting non-compliance in regulatory schemes

Gabriella Duddy — Clean Energy Regulator

Gabriella is using machine learning to help the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) detect non-compliance in its regulatory schemes.

She’s developing a process for the Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme to help the CER to use its resources more efficiently and strengthen the integrity of Australia’s Renewable Energy Target.

## Targeting biosecurity risks at airports

Dipangkar Kundu — Department of Agriculture and Water Resources

Dipangkar is developing an empirical model for identifying and targeting potential non-compliance biosecurity risks at Australian airports.

His model will help to find risk patterns and identify international travellers who carry a higher biosecurity risk.

## Improving survey accuracy

Daniel Merkas — Australian Bureau of Statistics

Daniel is developing machine-learning models to improve the quality and efficiency of the address register held by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

The register contains more than 10 million addresses and helps to improve surveys and link datasets to inform Australia’s important decisions.

He’ll use machine-learning algorithms to automate decisions that currently need people to carry them out and are resource-intensive.

## Simulation model for call-centre activities

Jack Xu — Department of Human Services

Jack is building a simulation model that will replicate the day-to-day telephone activities of the Department of Human Services.

He plans to show information including customer wait times, number of transferred calls, busy signals, level of staff occupancy and more. Jack’s model will enable his team to answer important business questions with more confidence than ever before.

## This year’s previous data fellows

These 7 data fellows for 2017-18 are in addition to the 3 announced in July 2017.

Those data felllows and their projects were:

## Using location data from business numbers

Oliver Berry — Australian Bureau of Statistics

Oliver used machine learning to explore new ways of using data from an Australian Business Number (ABN). This meant that business information could be analysed based on location.

## Assessing research funding levels

Tash Roujeinikova — National Health and Research Medical Council

Tash used machine learning techniques and text mining to show the level of interdisciplinary research funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council.

## Improving the timing of social media posts

Ross Ryan — Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet

Ross’s project aimed to predict and improve attendance at work-like activities in remote Australia after they were promoted through social media.

These are activities some job-seekers take part in to benefit their communities.
