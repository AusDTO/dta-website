A whole of government purchasing arrangement has been made with SAP to make it easier and cheaper for Australian government agencies to use their products and services. 

SAP provides products and services such software for business processes, cloud services for human resources and financial management systems. 

For agencies that already use SAP, this arrangement will start immediately. For other agencies, this will provide an easier way to purchase SAP products and services. Non-Corporate Commonwealth Entities are required to use this arrangement if they decide to use SAP products and services.
