I’m Leisa Reichelt and I lead the Service Design team here at the Digital Transformation Office. I’ve come back to Australia from the UK where I led the User Research team at the Government Digital Service.

Among the things I was most proud of in the UK were the amazing cross-government communities that built up around user research and design. This is something I’d love for us to build here in Australia, so we can all work together to build capability and improve consistency in the way we work, and to collaborate on creating public services that are simpler, clearer, faster and more humane.

To that end, we’ve set up a little mailing list and we’d love to invite anyone in any part of the Australian government who is doing service design work to join us. In our definition of service design, we include interaction design, web design, user research, usability, content/copy writing, web performance analysis and product management. In short, if you’re working to help design more human-focused services, you’re welcome to join us.

We hope to share questions, conversations and resources about service design and the disciplines that contribute to service design. We might also organise the occasional meet-up or video conference, to help us get to know colleagues around government and start to build rigour and consistency in the way that we work, together.

If you’d like to join the community, [you can sign up here](http://goo.gl/forms/5Yqe7he9qx). You’ll need a government email address or otherwise, leave a note to explain how you’re working on government services. If you can’t access the website to join the community, you can drop me an email at <leisa.reichelt@digital.gov.au> and I’ll add you to the list.

Looking forward to meeting you all and comparing notes!
