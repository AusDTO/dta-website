As part of our ICT procurement reforms, we are continuing to review our policies and contracts to make sure they reflect best practice in a rapidly changing technology environment.

This week we released the Digital Sourcing Contract Template. This is the first in a suite of model contracts to make it easier for government departments to buy digital products and services.

The new contract replaces SourceIT Plus and is simpler and more flexible than the previous template. By using the new template, those who are buying ICT and digital products for government don’t have to reinvent the wheel each time. Contracts with government for simple and semi-complex procurements will be more consistent for sellers.

Work is underway to update and simplify the other templates which are designed to be used when purchasing hardware, software and consultancy services.
