Capability, noun, the power or ability to do something.

Ninja, noun, a person who excels in a particular skill or activity.

Today is World Ninja Day. While it may have been created by a [burger company](https://nationaltoday.com/world/international-ninja-day/), ninjas mean more to us than speedy deliveries and the mysterious mask-wearing spies of Japanese culture. For us, ninjas are known for their skills, knowledge and perseverance. And their dedication to putting people first in the digital world.

## Ninjas of the government kind

Specialising in service design, product management, content, interaction design and user research, our ninjas will help us help you. They connect, nurture, and champion our people as they work across different products at the DTA and further afield. They also guide our work, create communities and share good practice.

The tools of their trade are: our content and service design groups; events including meetups, drop in clinics, sharebacks and conferences; and good old face time of the non-app kind.

## Building capability in the public service

Vanessa Roarty, our ninja for building capability across the Australian public service, has spent  20 years in digital roles across government including govCMS, myGov, My Health Record, govdex and australia.gov.au
