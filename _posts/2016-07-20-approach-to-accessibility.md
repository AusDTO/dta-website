*Caption: Jo Hill presenting research findings.*

The DTO is working with the Australian Public Service to transform government services to make them simpler, clearer and faster. Ensuring they are accessible to everyone who needs to use them is at the forefront of the service design process and a key requirement in the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/).

Hear case studies from DTO staff and other government agencies as they share resources and learnings from their own experiences. This interactive session will allow time for discussion and the sharing of ideas. This event is open to our colleagues working in all levels of government with an interest in a practical approach to accessibility in service design.
