Yesterday, the [Digital Service Standard](/standard/) moved to beta.

We [launched the alpha Digital Service Standard](/blog/release-of-the-alpha-digital-service-standard/) in April and have been [listening to your feedback](/blog/updates-to-the-scope-of-the-digital-service-standard/).

We’ve worked to make the Standard easier to understand. Our updates include:

- a new [service design and delivery process](/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/) to help guide the development of services
- articulation of user, service and government context
- the requirement to measure and report metrics appropriate to the service as well as those already established as the key performance indicators
- using responsive design so services can be accessed on the devices that users need
- making the requirement for inclusivity more explicit to ensure we meet the needs of all users regardless of their ability or environment
- showing the thing: demonstrating the end-to-end user experience of the service
- tweaks to the wording to make things clearer.

The Digital Service Standard team will be working with the other teams leading the [Digital Transformation Office’s work programme](/blog/announcing-our-work-programme/). We’ll be documenting the user journey taken by teams when designing a government service. We’ll also identify key trigger points and touch points with the Standard and other better practice information sources, which will give us a better understanding of what guidance you need to deliver better services.

Through the work programme, we’ll also be testing the assurance process to demonstrate that the services meet the Standard at the alpha, beta and live stages. Along the way we’ll publish case studies and bring you lots of practical insights about how the service teams are using the Standard, how they progress through the service design and delivery process, and how they go about meeting the Standard.

So stay tuned!
