searchexcerpt: Our Digital Marketplace has expanded to include a new Digital Training Marketplace, helping agencies build the skills they need to drive digital transformation across government.

---
The new [Digital Training Marketplace](URL) will make it easier for agencies to find the training and provider that best suits their needs. As part of the Digital Marketplace it also gives small and medium-sized enterprises easier access to government opportunities.

The Digital Training Marketplace is supported by new Learning Design Standards that have been developed with the Australian Public Service Commission and experts across government. These will help agencies and training providers ensure training is engaging and high quality.

The following standards are now available:

- agile delivery
- content design
- digital foundations
- user research

The remaining standards will be released in August 2018.

If your company provides digital specialist training you can apply for opportunities through the marketplace. Read more about [joining the Digital Marketplace](https://marketplace1.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/categories/115001540368-Seller-guide-and-FAQs).
