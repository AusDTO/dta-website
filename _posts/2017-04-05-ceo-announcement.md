Today the Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation Angus Taylor announced the appointment of Gavin Slater as CEO of the Digital Transformation Agency.

Mr Slater was previously a member of the Group Executive Team of the National Australia Bank where he drove a widespread digital transformation agenda across large, customer service businesses.

Assistant Minister Taylor said Mr Slater had led initiatives that overhauled NAB’s technology environment and delivered significantly improved customer experience.

“Gavin has a proven track record in driving transformational change to respond to digital disruption.”

“His experience will be invaluable as we move forward with whole-of-government improvements in digital delivery, a review of all major IT projects across government, as well as significant changes in the way we procure ICT services.” Assistant Minister Taylor said

Mr Slater will assume the CEO role from 1 May 2017, taking over from interim CEO, Nerida O’Loughlin.
