It’s therefore fantastic that the Digital Marketplace Beta — [released 5 months ahead of schedule](https://www.dto.gov.au/blog/digital-marketplace-beta/) — is already getting positive feedback from buyers and sellers. 

Chris O’Connor from the City of Casey, a local government office in Victoria, is just one of the 176 registered buyers on the Digital Marketplace. After his first experience he told us:

> In 14 years in government, this is the easiest procurement I’ve ever done. 

Our buyers aren’t just from federal government — there’s been strong uptake at local and state levels, as well as other government entities like the ABC and Melbourne Water.

Digital Marketplace sellers are also seeing the benefits of being able to compete for the [$15m of opportunities](https://marketplace.service.gov.au/digital-service-professionals/opportunities) listed so far. Just last Friday, Amith Attygalle from TP&G Solutions gave us this feedback:

> Being a small operator with no ‘contacts’ in Government or Industry, the Digital Marketplace is a miracle for us. We keep getting opportunities at a steady rate...keep up the good work.

Comments like these tell us we’re on the right track. By listening to our users and delivering the features in our roadmap, we know the Marketplace will get even better from here.
