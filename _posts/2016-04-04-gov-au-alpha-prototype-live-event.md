## How GOV.AU may affect government

Last month, the [GOV.AU Alpha prototype](https://www.gov.au/alpha/) was made public.

This is the first small step in GOV.AU’s mission to present government information and services based around the way people look for and use information &mdash; rather than around the way government is structured.

You’ve had a chance to take a look around the prototype and learn more about [our research](https://www.dto.gov.au/blog/gov-au-is-a-mental-model-for-government/) and our [content model](https://www.dto.gov.au/blog/gov-au-content-model-explained/). We'll now explain how these changes may affect government and address any questions you may have. 

We recognise that GOV.AU will be a substantial change to the way government information and services are currently structured. We welcome engagement and feedback from our stakeholders moving forward.
