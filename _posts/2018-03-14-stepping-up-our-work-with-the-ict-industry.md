In digital transformation, you can’t do it alone. This change requires all of us — government, industry, and the best and brightest minds across the economy — to deliver better results for the individuals and business that have to use government services to get things done.

This memorandum of understanding with the Australian Information Industry Association spells out how we aim to work together.

In it we commit to engage early, seek input, share ideas and draw on each others experience and expertise, to benefit major projects including our work on ICT procurement reforms, digital identity and building skills in digital disciplines across the Australian public service.   

In a statement welcoming the new agreement, our Chief Executive Officer Gavin Slater said involving industry in government transformation was crucial to success.

“The information and technology industry has much to offer government and by engaging early in the design and development of projects and programs, we have an opportunity to build in industry best practice, encourage innovation and make it easier to do business with government.”
