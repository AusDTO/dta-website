Millions of Australians use myGov to do business with government. So it’s important we find ways to make the user experience as simple, clear and fast as possible. 

Since mid-2016 the Department of Human Services and the DTA have been working together to deliver improvements to myGov. Some of the first changes were rolled out at the end of [last year](https://www.dta.gov.au/news/digital-steps-to-benefit-users/), including making it possible for users to sign in with their email address rather than a system generated user name.

A new look and feel for the service has now been rolled out. This latest update to the service was shaped by user research, which told us it was difficult to find services, some information was hard to understand, and users wanted to be confident they were on a trusted government site.

Among a wide range of changes, the new myGov has a simpler design and layout. Member services logos are more prominent to make it easier to find the service a user needs. We’ve also made the Australian Government crest larger.

We’ve made the language clearer and simpler and reduced the amount of information on the site. 

And the new myGov is more mobile friendly with a responsive design so users can access government services on the go with their mobile or tablet. 

User research has been key to the ongoing transformation of myGov since the DHS – DTA partnership began. Hundreds of hours of research has been conducted in more than 20 metropolitan, regional and rural locations. This included speaking with people from different walks of life, with different accessibility needs, of different ages, and in different geographical locations.

This research will continue now the new myGov is live and we can see what impact the changes have made.
