Many people would like the choice of being able to access government services online.

At the moment, even if you can do part of the process online, you still need to take 100 points of ID to a government service centre to have your identity checked in person.

Govpass will let you complete this process entirely online on your computer, phone or tablet.

## How it works

To create your Govpass you’ll be asked to enter details from some of your identity documents --- such as your Australian birth certificate, passport, driver’s licence and Medicare card. This information will be used to verify your identity.

The details for these documents will be checked against existing government records within seconds. For example, your Medicare card details will be checked with the Medicare office and your birth certificate will be verified against the records of the state where you were born. 

You’ll also need to confirm that you match your photo ID. You’ll be able to do this online, using the camera on your device. Your photo will be checked against the photo ID you provided, and then Govpass deletes it.

## Create once, use it over and over

You’ll only have to go through this process once to create your Govpass digital identity. The whole process takes between 5 and 10 minutes.

Your Govpass will be trusted by government services online. You’ll be able to use it over and over again, each time you use a different government service. 

Govpass is currently being tested privately with a few select services. Next year it is expected that it will be tested with a broader number of services and users.

Watch the video to see how easy it will be to set up a Govpass.

The Australian Government is making it easier to prove who you are when you use government services online. 

On screen: ‘We are making it easier to access government services online’

At the moment, to prove your identity to government, you need to do it in person; and you may have to do it each time you use a different service.

We are trialling a new system called Govpass, that will change this by giving you the choice to set up a Digital Identity.

On screen: user on Govpass website on laptop

On screen: ‘How to create a Govpass’ home screen’

Here’s how it will work:

On screen: ‘How govpass works’ page. User agrees to give permission for Govpass to use their information as listed above 
To create your Govpass account, you’ll complete a few simple steps.

On screen: ‘What you need to create a Govpass’ page. User affirms they are ready to start; clicks ‘yes, I have these documents’

To start, you’ll provide some basic contact details. Then you’ll need to confirm your identity. 

This is similar to the 100 point ID check you have probably done in person.

On screen: ‘Set up your email’ page. User enters email

On screen: ‘Enter code from email’ page. User enters email code

On screen: ‘Secure your account’ page. User enters mobile number

On screen: ‘Enter code from mobile’ page. User enters 6-digit code

On screen: ‘Enter your recovery email’ page. User enters recovery email

You’ll be asked to provided details from a number of documents, such as your Medicare card, driver’s licence or birth certificate.

Here’s the process using your Medicare card. 

On screen: ‘Create your Govpass account’ page. User selects ‘Enter your Medicare card’

On screen: ‘Take a photo of your Medicare card’ page. User selects ‘No, enter details manually’

You’ll have the option to take a photo of your card, or enter a few details, starting with the colour of your card, then your card’s expiry date, and the numbers and name on your card. 

On screen: ‘Select your Medicare card colour’ page. User selects green

On screen: ‘Enter your Medicare card expiry date’ page. User enters expiry date

On screen: ‘Enter your Medicare card number’ page. User enters card number

On screen: ‘Enter your name’ page. User enters name as show on card

On screen: ‘Enter your individual reference number’ page. User enters Individual Reference Number

These details are checked with the Medicare Office, and if they match they will be verified within seconds. 

On screen: ‘Confirm your Medicare card details’ page. User selects ‘Confirm details’

On screen: ‘Medicare card details confirmed with Medicare Office’

To ensure the integrity of your Digital Identity, you’ll be asked to provide details from a couple of other documents. This will help Govpass make sure you are who you say you are.

On screen: ‘Match your face to the photo on your document’ page

On screen: ‘Check your camera works’ page. Govpass confirms camera is working

You’ll be asked to use the camera on your device or computer to take a photo of yourself. This will be checked against your passport or driver’s licence record.

Importantly, only your basic contact details are kept by Govpass. The other details, including your photo, are discarded as soon as they have been matched against your existing records.
