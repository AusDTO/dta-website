We know that many people would like the choice of being able to access government services online.

At the moment, even if you can do part of the process online, you might be familiar with taking 100 points of ID to a government service centre to have your identity checked in person.

Govpass will let you complete this process entirely online on your tablet, phone or computer.

To create your Govpass you’ll be asked to enter details from some identity documents --- such as your Australian birth certificate, passport, driver’s licence and Medicare card --- to verify your identity.

The details for these documents will be checked within seconds. For example, your Medicare card details will be checked with the Medicare office and your birth certificate will be verified against the records of the state where you were born. 

You’ll also need to confirm your photo ID with Govpass. You’ll be able to do this online, using the camera on your device. 

Only your basic contact details are kept by Govpass Your photo will be checked against the record of either your driver’s licence or passport and then Govpass deletes it. 

Importantly, you’ll only have to go through this process once to create your Govpass digital identity. The whole process will take between 5 and 10 minutes.

Your Govpass will be trusted by government services online so you’ll be able to use it over and over again to do business with different . 

Govpass is in limited testing. Next year it is expected the service will be tested with a broader number of services and users.

The Australian Government is making it easier to prove who you are when you use government services online. 

On screen: ‘We are making it easier to access government services online’

At the moment, to prove your identity to government, you need to do it in person; and you may have to do it each time you use a different service.

We are trialling a new system called Govpass, that will change this by giving you the choice to set up a Digital Identity.

On screen: ‘How to create a Govpass’ home screen’

Here’s how it will work:

On screen: ‘How govpass works’ page. User agrees to give permission for Govpass to use their information as listed above 
To create your Govpass account, you’ll complete a few simple steps.

On screen: ‘What you need to create a Govpass’ page. User affirms they are ready to start; clicks ‘yes, I have these documents’

To start, you’ll provide some basic contact details. Then you’ll need to confirm your identity. 

This is similar to the 100 point ID check you have probably done in person.

On screen: ‘Set up your email’ page. User enters email

On screen: ‘Enter code from email’ page. User enters email code

On screen: ‘Secure your account’ page. User enters mobile number

On screen: ‘Enter code from mobile’ page. User enters 6-digit code

On screen: ‘Enter your recovery email’ page. User enters recovery email

You’ll be asked to provided details from a number of documents, such as your Medicare card, driver’s licence or birth certificate.

On screen: ‘Take a photo of your Medicare card’ page. User selects ‘No, enter details manually’

You’ll have the option to take a photo of your card, or enter a few details, starting with the colour of your card, then your card’s expiry date, and the numbers and name on your card.
