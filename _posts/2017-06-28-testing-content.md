At the DTA, we’ve started a discovery process to develop a strategy that will help government agencies choose cloud technologies, if and when appropriate."

## Test content

Most of us use cloud services, whether we realise it or not. We use cloud to contact friends and to share stories, images and news through social media and we use cloud storage services to store our data and information from computers and smartphones. Cloud offers the convenience of accessing computing services as we need them, via the internet. 

For many organisations, adopting cloud services requires different skills and a major change in culture. For government, adopting cloud services could reduce costs, lift productivity and deliver better services. For example, we may reduce costs by being able to use ready-to-go cloud-based applications and provide a better user experience through more cohesive government services. Cloud can also make it easier for us to share resources and capabilities.This could lead to less ‘reinventing the wheel’ and increase our ability to share improvements in business processes and systems.

Cloud provides government with the opportunity to develop and use shared platforms and capabilities that can benefit everyone.  

### What is ‘secure cloud’ for government?

Secure cloud is a term we use for services able to meet the privacy and security requirements for critical government systems. It means that government can use cloud with confidence. This is important because government agencies have often faced challenges adopting cloud for services handling sensitive information. 

Investing in cloud services isn’t new for government. Current government policy requires agencies to consider cloud solutions as a priority when rolling out or replacing ICT infrastructure, applications or services. For government to get real value and efficiencies from using cloud we need to go further to ensure government has the skills, knowledge and confidence to manage secure cloud services.

The [Australian Signals Directorate recently certified](https://www.asd.gov.au/infosec/irap/certified_clouds.htm) two cloud service providers to store classified information. This announcement provides agencies with more options to use cloud storage in a secure way and in line with government policies. Another nine providers are already certified to store sensitive information that is not categorised as classified. As more cloud providers enter these markets, the opportunities for government to adopt cloud solutions will increase, as will the market opportunities for providers of cloud services.
