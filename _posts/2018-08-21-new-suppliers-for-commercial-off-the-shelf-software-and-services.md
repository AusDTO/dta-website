searchexcerpt: Weâ€™re on the hunt for new Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software and services providers to join our Software Licensing and Services Panel.

The Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) has [released a Request for Tender](https://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.atm.show&ATMUUID=80F2A20B-AA6A-FD62-9E21975A519E8C26) (RFT) calling for providers of COTS software and services for inclusion on our Software Licensing and Services Panel.

The Software Licensing and Services Panel was established earlier this year, with the first category being for a Microsoft Licensing Solutions Provider.

In June, we released a Request for Information for a new category: COTS software. We appreciated the overwhelming response to the request for information, and have since incorporated many of the suggestions into our development of the new category.

Now, the DTA is looking for providers to come on board. We hope to appoint multiple sellers to the new category.

Potential suppliers have until 2pm on 20 September 2018 to lodge their tenders, which will need to be lodged electronically via [AusTender](https://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.atm.show&ATMUUID=80F2A20B-AA6A-FD62-9E21975A519E8C26) before the tender closing time.
