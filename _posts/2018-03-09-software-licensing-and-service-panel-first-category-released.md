The first category of the new Software Licensing and Services panel has been released.

Following a tender process which closed on 14 September 2017, Data#3 have been selected as the provider of Microsoft licensing solutions, the first category to go live.

More categories will be added to the new panel over time, as a number of other panels are phased out, or not renewed as they expire.

The new panel is being built to be flexible, so categories can be added as needed, and ‘open often’, so new sellers can join regularly.

For government, it means new categories can be added to the panels as technology evolves.
