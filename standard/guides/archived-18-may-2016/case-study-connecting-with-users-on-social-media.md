The Department of Human Services (DHS) and CSIRO monitor user feedback across social media channels, supporting the communications team to understand trends and engage their users in relevant discussions.

## What we do
Staff at DHS monitor user comments on forums across the internet. They pick up trends in discussions about DHS work and opportunities to help users who are having difficulties interacting with DHS. This is done through a processing tool that is topic-based and uses natural language called Vizie, developed with the help of CSIRO.

Vizie picks up on the topics of discussion that could be relevant to DHS staff, even in unusual online locations like video game or caravanning forums. DHS staff can then engage in the conversation to solve clientsâ€™ problems where it will be useful, or track the conversation as part of a broader watch over trends. These trends can provide insight into where there are emerging issues with DHS programs, or opportunities to improve services.

## Lessons learnt
The DHS use of Vizie for social media monitoring is ongoing for Centrelink and other major programs. DHS and CSIRO are also looking at other areas that Vizie can be useful, including through integration with WeFeel. This is a CSIRO tool that tracks the mood and emotions expressed in social media communities.
