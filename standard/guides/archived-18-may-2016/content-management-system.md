The Digital Transformation Office will develop detailed guidance on how to choose an appropriate content management system (CMS) over the coming months.

In the meantime, consider the following guidelines:

1.  Assess whether a new or refreshed website is required at all, or whether the content or functionality could be retired, migrated on to an existing website or shared service. For example, your portfolio agency website might be an option. Alternatively, the core Australian Government entry points ([australia.gov.au](http://www.australia.gov.au/) and [business.gov.au](http://www.business.gov.au/)) are whole-of-government content platforms that enable you to deliver your content in a cost-effective way.
2.  Consider [GovCMS](https://www.govcms.gov.au/). This service provides agencies with a standards compliant, security assessed and fully supported content management system that aligns with the vision of the DTO.
3.  Investigate cloud hosted options for your site. It is government policy to take a cloud first approach to new websites.
4.  Explore other existing options within your agency as there may be arrangements you can leverage to avoid duplication of infrastructure or contracts.

Agencies must continue to ensure that any new websites meet all mandatory requirements around [accessibility](/standard/design-guides/making-content-accessible/), [branding](/standard/design-guides/branding/), [design](/standard/design-guides/user-centred-design/), [common look and feel](/standard/design-guides/common-website-elements/), [security](/standard/design-guides/secure-services/) and hosting arrangements.
